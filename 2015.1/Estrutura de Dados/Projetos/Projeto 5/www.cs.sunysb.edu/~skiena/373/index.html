CURRENT GRADES (12/2/04)  --
See your <A href="grades/12-02-posting.doc">raw scores and average</a> to date.
If I had to assign grades today, I would say the borders are <i>grossly roughly about</i>:
80's and 90's get As,
60's and 70's get Bs,
40's and 50's get Cs,
with 30's and especially 20's in danger of lower grades.

<h3>Extra Credit</h3>


Interested students may attempt the following
extra credit programming challenges from
Skiena/Revilla
for a small amount of
additional points -- small enough that you should be motivated primarily
by interest and not greed.
<p>
The solutions to these problems must be submitted on
<a href="http://www.programming-challenges.com">www.programming-challenges.com</a>.
Register for an account and join my CSE 373 extra credit class if you
are intersted.
<p>
A schedule for doing these problems that is somewhat consistant
with this course is:

<ul>

<li>
week 1:	110101  3n+1

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>
The objectives for the course are

<ul>
<li>
Provide a rigorous introduction to worst-case asymptotic algorithm analysis.
<li>
Develop classical graph and combinatorial algorithms for such problems as sorting, shortest paths and minimum spanning trees.
<li>
Introduce the concept of computational intractability and NP completeness.
</ul>

<p>
The course will also satisfy the following
<a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/admissions/ObjectivesMapping.html">
program objective</a>:

<ul>
<li>
(S6) have a solid understanding of computational theory and
foundational mathematics.

</ul>
