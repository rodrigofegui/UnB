<h2><center>Introduction</center></h2>
</P>
<P>
If you are looking at this page, you probably have an interest in (or
have been told by a professor to have an interest in) computers and ethics.
</P>
<P>
<B>Ethics</B>  One definition of ethics, according to Merriam-Webster,
is "a set of moral principles or values".  You may derive your own
personal ethics from many sources: your family and culture, your
religion or faith, the legal system where you live, etc.  
However, ethics in general is not the topic of this web page.
</P>
<P>
<B>Computing Ethics</B> Sometimes you will hear someone refer to
"computing ethics", which is a whole range of ethical questions
surrounding computer science and the use of computers.  This is also
not the primary topic of this web page, although it is addressed.  If
this is your primary interest, you might also want to take a look at <A
HREF="http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds1-4/soc_orgs.html">Social
Responsibility and the CS Student</A>, which appeared in the ACM
Crossroads Student Magazine in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
<B>Professional Ethics</B>  This web page discusses professional
ethics (or professional practice): the "principles of conduct" that we
agree to be governed by as computer scientists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
As a student at Stony Brook, you have agreed to follow the
university's rules regarding  
<A HREF="http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/newstudents/nsintegrity.shtml">academic honesty</A>
and 
<A HREF="http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/newstudents/nsresponsible.shtml">appropriate conduct</A>.
These are a statement of professional conduct for students.  Faculty
have their own rules regarding professional conduct (the Computer
Science faculty have adopted a statement which will soon be on the
department's web site).  Depending on where you are in life, you may
have several different sets of professional ethics to adhere to.  It
is important to think about who you are, what roles you play, and how
you can act professionally in those different roles.
</P>

<P>

This web page is one place for you to start thinking about
professional ethics.  Professional ethics is also a topic in the
syllabus in the following courses:
<UL>
<LI><A href="/undergrad/cse_courses/cse110.html">CSE110</A></LI>
<LI><A href="/undergrad/cse_courses/cse114.html">CSE114</A></LI>

<LI><A href="/undergrad/cse_courses/cse302.html">CSE302</A></LI>
<LI><A href="/undergrad/cse_courses/cse308.html">CSE308</A></LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
CSE114, CSE219 and CSE308 are required for all CSE/ISE majors.  For
CSE308 students must write an essay on a topic related to software
engineering ethics.  Students may also write an essay on software
engineering ethics to satisfy the requirements for CSE300.

<BIG>Codes of Ethics</BIG>
</P>

<P>

There are many computer science-related organizations that have codes of ethics (Berleur and Brunnstein 1996).  However, most computer scientists are members of the ACM or the IEEE, and so have agreed to be bound by one of the following:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html">The ACM Code of Ethics</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.acm.org/serving/se/code.htm">The ACM/IEEE Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=corp_level1&path=about/whatis&file=code.xml&xsl=generic.xsl">The IEEE Code of Ethics</A>
</UL>
</P>

<P>

Printouts of the ACM/IEEE code of ethics are available in the Computer Science Building outside the office of the undergraduate secretary.

</P>
<P>

<B>What you can do:</B> Look up one of the above codes of ethics.
Read it.  Print it out and save it for reference.  It is there to
protect and guide you, as well as to protect those you work with and
for.

Most large companies have an ethics officer, who is there to educate
and advise employees about issues relating to professional practice.
You may meet one or more of the ethics officers from local companies,
such as CA, Symbol and Reuters, during your time at Stony Brook.

</P>
<P>

Organizations that are broadly considered to &quot;be about&quot; ethics of computing, or professional practice in computer science, include:
<UL>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.ccsr.cse.dmu.ac.uk/">The Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility</A>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.southernct.edu/organizations/rccs/">The Research Center on Computing & Society at Southern Connecticut State University</A>
</UL>

</P>
<P>

<B>What you can do:</B> Look up one or more of the organizations
above.  Become aware of the ethical issues computer scientists and
engineers face.  Know that these organizations may be resources for
you to use in case of an ethical conflict.  Think about becoming
involved.

<LI>New York Times, January 23, 2002:  Master Key Copying Revealed.  A computer security researcher applies his research techniques to a brick-and-mortar task:  master key copying.  He and his company then face the ethical question of whether, and how, to release this information.
<LI>New York Times, August 22, 2002:  For the Doctor's Touch, Help in the Hand.  An article about the use of PDAs in medicine.  Discussion of technology and patient privacy.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.privacilla.org/government/carnivore.html">Website on Carnivore</A>.  Includes a discussion of the responsibilities of computer scientists in the area of individual privacy.

<LI>There are many articles about security holes in commonly-used software.  For example, the NYTimes reported on Dec. 1 2003 that a computer scientist had found holes in Internet Explorer.  Instead of informing Microsoft first, the computer scientist publicized his findings on public mailing lists.
<LI>Information Week runs a series on technology and ethics.  Articles are archived online.
</UL>

In the future, links to more computing ethics topics that come up in
the news will be posted here.

There have also been discussions about how to incorporate professional ethics in to the computer science curriculum:

<B>What you can do:</B> Take a course in professional ethics, or
issues relating to technology and society (related courses you can
take at Stony Brook, some of which count for a DEC H, include: BUS347,
SOC315, EST201, EST302, EST391, PHI104, PHI230, PHI364, PHI372,
WISE242, BME201, various ITS courses).  Look at some of the case
studies on the websites above.  Think about them.  What would you do?
Other examples (bad and good) of professional practice in computer
science are frequently to be found on the front pages of such
newspapers as the New York Times.  Become aware.  Become educated.

<BR><B>My comments:</B>  Standard computing ethics textbook.  Chapter 10 includes a set of test cases which may be helpful.  Has a  <A HREF="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/giftfire/">website</A> with teaching resources, the <A HREF="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/giftfire/">website</A> includes sample assignments and quizzes, and an extensive collection of links.

Jacques Berleur and Klaus Brunnstein, Ethics of Computing:  Codes, spaces for discussion and law, Chapman & Hall, 1996.</I></B><BR>
<B>My comments:</B>  A collection from the IFIP Ethics Task Group.  Interesting for faculty, much less so as an undergraduate text book.  Includes a collection of codes of ethics from different professional societies (related to CS) in different countries.

  <BR><B>My comments:</B>  More of a scare tactics book than an ethics book; doesn't distinguish between professional ethics (software engineering ethics) and computing ethics.  Also in one of the appendices makes the startling claim that computer ethics are not far removed from computer aesthetics!

Kenneth Goodman (ed.), Ethics, Computing, and Medicine:  Informatics and the Transformation of Health Care, Cambridge University Press, 1998.</I></B><BR>

+Richard Spinello, Case Studies in Information and Computer Ethics, Prentice Hall, 1997.</I></B><BR>
  <B>Sections cover:</B>  Ethics, Computers and Information; Frameworks for Ethical Analysis; The Acquisition of Information; Information Access; Information Stewardship; Software Ownership and Intellectual Property Issues; Computer Security and Computer Crimes; Liability, Safety, and Reliability; The Social Impact of Computer Technology.
  <BR><B>My comments:</B>  The bulk of the book is roughly 38 case studies.  Good for undergraduates, if used in conjunction with a statement of professional ethics and resources for identifying social, legal issues.  (There may now be a new edition out.)
