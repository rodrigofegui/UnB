<h3>Q. What is Computer Science?</h3>
<p><b>A. </b> Computer Science is a field that takes a broad approach to computing.
It covers all aspects of modern computer systems, and their ever-increasing role in contemporary society. Students majoring in CS will acquire deep theoretical and technical
understanding, as well as practical knowledge of computer software and hardware development.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Q. What kind of jobs do CS majors graduating from Stony Brook get?</h3>
<p><b>A. </b> Some traditional job titles include Computer Programmer, Software Engineer,
Systems/Network/Database Administrator, Computer Architect and Designer. However, computer scientists hold positions as diverse as the applications of
computer technology -- ranging from Computer Animators to Engineering Managers, Team
Supervisors and more. Some of our graduates work for top companies located on Long
Island such as Computer Associates and Symbol Technologies, while the rest pursue opportunities around the country or even the world at large. We have our graduates
at Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, and the current president of Stanford University is an alumnus of Stony Brook CS! Our graduates
also find positions in the financial industry - top Wall Street companies such as Citigroup and Lehman Brothers have hired dozens of our graduating
undergraduates over the past few years. There are many positions in the Government
sector as well, including those related to National security. Northrop Grumman
Corporation, one of of the largest defense companies, has a significant presence on Long Island and employs many of our graduates.
Our top undergraduate students often choose to continue their education on graduate level.</p>
<h3>Q. Why should I study Computer Science at all?  I've heard some people who do not
have a CS degree and were still able to make big money as programmers.</h3>
<p><b>A.</b> People who learn a given computer technology can often find entry-level positions
without formal training, but everything related to computers changes very fast.   Indeed, many of the technologies you will learn during your stay in school
will likely be obsolete within five-to-ten years.   However, the principles you learn here will enable you to keep understand and master the new technologies as they
come out.   People who have learned specific technologies instead of the fundamental principles will not be able to make that jump.</p>
<h3>Q. So, is Computer Science just coding?</h3>
<p><b>A.</b> Not at all. Of course, computer scientists do often write code. However, you might
think of CS as taking real life problems, and reducing their complexity to a level that
even machines can "understand".  Solving larger-scale real problems is both difficult
and fun. This requires extensive higher-level system design and problem solving skills.  With the proper
design, actually coding the program often becomes a relatively straightforward part
of the job.</p>
<h3>Q. What about that dot-com crash? Will I be able to find a job with a CS degree?</h3>
<p><b>A.</b> As any other discipline and the Economy as a whole, Computer Science is
subject to cycles of higher and lower labor demand. The very publicized nature of the
dot-com crash led to an impression of a particularly severe lack of opportunities for
graduating computer scientists. However, according to recently released long-term government projections
( see <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecopro.t04.htm">US Department of
Labor data</a> for example) three of the top 10 fastest growing occupations through the year 2012 are
expected to be those requiring CS Bachelor s degree. These fields all have a projected overall growth rate above 40%.</p>
<h3>Q. But wait!  Aren't all CS jobs currently being outsourced to India and other countries?</h3>
<p><b>A.</b> Empirical evidence suggests that many of jobs being outsourced are those which
do not require CS degree in the first place, such as software quality assurance and routine programming tasks.   On the contrary, there are many types of CS jobs
which are unlikely to go overseas, for example those requiring direct interaction
with US customers or those related to national security. Still, students should prepare themselves to the changing environment. It is more
important than ever to develop problem solving, team management and other relevant skills rather than
concentrate just on learning how to program. As long as the US is at the forefront of economic, technical, and scientific activity, new
challenges in computing and its applications will be formulated here, so people who can
understand such problems and convert them into code will remain in demand. The well-publicized fears of outsourcing have recently excessively reduced the number of
students majoring in computer science.   The law of supply and demand implies that Computer Science presents an excellent career opportunity for those brave
enough to go against the crowd.</p>
<h3>Q. What are typical income levels for a CS graduate?</h3>
<p>According to the <b>fall survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers</b>, the following are the top ten in-demand majors for students graduating in 2009 with starting salaries:<br><br>

Top ten in-demand majors from the Class of 2009 Major Average Salary Offer<br><br>

Computer Science $61,110<br>
Computer Engineering $60,280<br>
Electrical Engineering $57,603<br>
Mechanical Engineering $57,024<br>
Information Sciences & Systems $52,322<br>
Management Information Systems $51,489<br>
Economics/Finance $51,062<br>
Accounting $48,020<br>
Business Administration/Management $46,171<br>
Marketing/Marketing Mgmt. $41,506<br><br>


</p>

<h3>Q. I am very interested in computers and was wondering which major to
choose: Computer Science or Computer Engineering. What is the difference between the two
programs, anyway?</h3>
<p><b>A.</b> This is a very common question.  Although there is considerable overlap
between the two fields, Computer Science focuses primarily on software systems, while
Computer Engineering on hardware systems.  Software application development, Internet programming, and  database/information management systems are more the
province of Computer Science, while Computer Engineers often work in embedded system development and low level hardware design. It is fair to say that the amount of software development performed in the US greatly
exceeds that of hardware development, and that nationally far more students study
Computer Science than Computer Engineering.<br>
 Both majors will teach you basic programming, fundamentals of computer hardware
and will give you the skills necessary for creating software and hardware systems to
solve problems in the real world.  However, CS deals more with the "science" of computers, putting more emphasis on algorithm development/analysis and efficient
ways of storing/processing information, while the CE track stresses more the engineering aspects of hardware systems.  To put it another way, CE studies ways
to build good computer systems while CS tries to figure out what to do with them.
</p>

<h3 ALIGN="LEFT">Q. What undergraduate programs does your department offer?</h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>A.</b> We offer Bachelor of Science programs in Computer
Science (CSE) and in Information Systems (ISE).
Computer science majors may participate in a concentration
in Human-Computer Interaction, Information Assurance and Game programming.
Qualified computer science majors may apply to the departmental honors program
and/or the joint BS/MS program.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="LEFT">Q. What is the difference between computer science and
information systems?</h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>A.</b> Our information systems program is structured as an 
applied computer program,
the application area being business information systems. Computer
science majors may choose a variety of different electives (e.g.,
programming languages, databases, computer graphics) and take
more natural science and mathematics courses, whereas information systems
majors follow a more focused computing curriculum and take additional
business or economics courses.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="LEFT">Q. What is the typical class size in your courses?</h3>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>A.</b> First-year courses (100 level) have about 100-150
students; second-year courses (200 level),
about 80-100 students. The lectures for these courses
are taught by professors and are complemented by recitations and/or
laboratories, taught by teaching assistants to smaller groups of about
25 students. Upper-division (300 and 400
level) class size ranges from 20–30 students for
special topics courses to 60–90 students in the most popular courses.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="LEFT">Q. Do graduate students teach courses?</h3>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>A.</b> All core courses (first and second year) are taught by
faculty. Upper-level courses are occasionally
taught by advanced graduate students.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="LEFT">Q. Do computer science students need to buy their own computer?</h3>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>A.</b> Students need not buy their own computing equipment.
Our first-year courses are supported by
facilities maintained by the University Computing Center.
Later courses are supported by our own instructional laboratories.
Students with their own computer have access to the campus network
from campus residences. Departmental research
laboratories are available to undergraduates working on
research projects supervised by our faculty.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="LEFT">Q. What programming languages do you teach?</h3>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>A.</b> In the introductory courses we use primarily Java and
cover C to a modest extent. Upper-level
courses typically use Java, C, or C++.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="LEFT">Q. Do you accept advance placement credits?</h3>
<p ALIGN="left"><b>A. </b>Students get credit depending on the computer science
exam taken and the score achieved:
