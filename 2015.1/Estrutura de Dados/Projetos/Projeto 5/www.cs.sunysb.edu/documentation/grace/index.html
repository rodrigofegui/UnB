<P><HR>
<EM>  This document explains the usage of
  <B>Grace</B>, a WYSIWYG 2D plotting tool for scientific data.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
<P>
<H2>1.1 What is Grace?  </H2>

<P>Grace is a WYSIWYG tool to make two-dimensional plots of scientific
data. It runs under various (if not all) flavors of Unix with
X11 and Motif (LessTif). It also runs under VMS, OS/2, and Windows
(95/98/NT). Its capabilities are roughly similar to GUI-based
programs like Sigmaplot or Microcal Origin plus script-based
tools like Gnuplot or Genplot. Its strength lies in the fact
that it combines the convenience of a graphical user interface
with the power of a scripting language which enables it to do
sophisticated calculations or perform automated tasks.
<P>Grace is derived from Xmgr (a.k.a. ACE/gr), originally written by
Paul Turner.
<P>From version number 4.00, the development was taken over by a
team of volunteers under the coordination of Evgeny Stambulchik.
You can get the newest information about Grace and download the
latest version at the 
<A HREF="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">Grace home page</A>.
<P>When its copyright was changed to GPL, the name was changed to Grace,
which stands for ``GRaphing, Advanced Computation and Exploration of
data'' or ``Grace Revamps ACE/gr''. The first version of Grace available
is named 5.0.0, while the last public version of Xmgr has the version
number 4.1.2.
<P>Paul still maintains and develops a non-public version of Xmgr for
internal use.

<H2>2.1 Installing from sources    </H2>

<P>
<OL>
<LI> Configuration 
<A NAME="configuration"></A> 
<UL>
<LI> Requirements.
Grace usually compiles out of the box in a regular Unix-like
environment. You need an ANSI C compiler (gcc is just fine),
the X11R5 or above libraries and headers, and Motif-1.2 or
above.
If you want to compile your own changes to certain parts of
Grace, you will need a parser generator (<CODE>yacc</CODE> or, better,
<CODE>bison</CODE>).</LI>
<LI> Extra libraries. Some features will be available only if
additional libraries are installed. Those are:
<UL>
<LI> The JPEG backend needs the IJG's
(
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/">JPEG library</A>),
version 6.x.</LI>
<LI> The PNG backend needs
the (
<A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/">libpng</A>)
library (version 0.96 or above).</LI>
<LI> The PDF driver requires the PDFlib library of Thomas
Merz to be installed, which is available
<A HREF="http://www.pdflib.com/">here</A>, version
3.00 or above.</LI>
<LI> If your computer has the FFTW library installed when
Grace is compiled, Grace will link itself to this, and
drop all conventional FFT's and DFT's. All transforms
will be routed through this package. Note that there is
then no difference between pushing the "FFT" button and
the "DFT" button, except that FFT will complain if the
length isn't a power of 2, and DFT will not.

For more information on this package, see the 
<A HREF="http://www.fftw.org">FFTW Home page</A>.
In short, this package allows one to do non-power-of-2
length FFT's along with the normal ones.  It seems to work
very efficiently for any set length which factors into 2^a
3^b 5^c 7^d for integer a, b, c, d. The great feature here
is that set lengths which are powers of 10 (e.g. 1000,
10000) and integer multiples of these (500, 2000, 2500,
5000, etc.) can be computed with no significant penalty
(maybe 20%) over power-of-2 transforms. Very often, real
datasets come in these sizes, and not in powers of 2.</LI>
<LI> In order to read/write sets in the NetCDF data format, you
will also need the 
<A HREF="http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html">NetCDF libraries</A>.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI> Decide whether you want to compile in a separate place (thus
leaving the source tree pristine). You most probably would
want it if compiling Grace for more than one OS and keeping
the sources in a central shared (e.g. via NFS) location.
If you don't need it, skip the rest of this paragraph and go
right to the next step. Otherwise, assuming the sources are
in <CODE>/usr/local/src/grace-x.y.z</CODE> and the compilation
will be performed in <CODE>/tmp/grace-obj</CODE>, do the following:
<PRE>
  % mkdir /tmp/grace-obj
  % cd /tmp/grace-obj
  % /usr/local/src/grace-x.y.z/ac-tools/shtool mkshadow \
    /usr/local/src/grace-x.y.z .
                 
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI> The <CODE>configure</CODE> shell script attempts to guess correct
values for various system-dependent variables used during
compilation. It uses those values to create <CODE>Make.conf</CODE> in the
top directory of the package. It also create <CODE>config.h</CODE> file
containing system-dependent definitions. Finally, it creates a shell
script <CODE>config.status</CODE> that you can run in the future to
recreate the current configuration, a file <CODE>config.cache</CODE> that
saves the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring, and a file
<CODE>config.log</CODE> containing compiler output (useful mainly for
debugging <CODE>configure</CODE>). If at some point <CODE>config.cache</CODE>
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.</LI>
<LI> Run <CODE>./configure --help</CODE>
to get list of additional switches specific to Grace</LI>
<LI> Run <CODE>./configure &lt;options&gt;</CODE>. Just an example:
<PRE>
  % ./configure --enable-grace-home=/opt/grace 
    --with-extra-incpath=/usr/local/include:/opt/include \
    --with-extra-ldpath=/usr/local/lib:/opt/lib --prefix=/usr
                 
</PRE>

would use <CODE>/usr/local/include</CODE> and
<CODE>/opt/include</CODE> in addition to the default include path
and <CODE>/usr/local/lib</CODE> and <CODE>/opt/lib</CODE> in addition
to the default ld path. As well, all stuff would be put under
the /opt/grace directory and soft links made to
<CODE>/usr/bin</CODE>, <CODE>/usr/lib</CODE> and <CODE>/usr/include</CODE>.
<P><B>Note</B>: If you change one of the
<CODE>--with-extra-incpath</CODE> or
<CODE>--with-extra-ldpath</CODE> options from one run of
configure to another, remember to delete the
<CODE>config.cache</CODE> file!!!

<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="datasets"></A> Datasets         </H3>

<P>A dataset is a collection of points with x and y coordinates, up to
four optional data values (which, depending on the set type, can be
displayed as error bars or like) and one optional character string.
<H3><A NAME="regions"></A> Regions         </H3>

<P>
<P>Regions are sections of the graph defined by the interior or exterior
of a polygon, or a half plane defined by a line. Regions are used to
restrict data transformations to a geometric area occupied by region.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="RTI"></A> Real Time Input         </H3>

<P>
<P>Real Time Input refers to the ability Grace has to be
fed in real time by an external program. The Grace
process spawned by the driver program is a full featured
Grace process: the user can interact using the GUI at the
same time the program sends data and commands. The process
will adapt itself to the incoming data rate.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="hotlinks"></A> Hotlinks         </H3>

<P>
<P>Hotlinks are sources containing varying data. Grace can be
instructed a file or a pipe is a hotlink in which case it
will provide specific commands to refresh the data on a
mouse click (a later version will probably allow automatic
refresh).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="files-formats"></A> File formats         </H3>

<P>
<P>Grace understands several input files formats. The most
basic one is ASCII text files containing space and comma
separated columns of data. The data fields can be either
numeric (Fortran 'd' and 'D' exponent markers are supported)
or alphanumeric (with or without quotes). Several calendar
date formats are recognized automatically and you can
specify your own reference for numeric dates formats. Grace also
has a command language (see 
<A HREF="#command-interpreter">command interpreter</A>), you can include commands in
data files using lines having "@" as their first non-blank
character. Depending on configuration, Grace can also read
NetCDF files (see 
<A HREF="#configuration">configuration</A>).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="devices"></A> Devices        </H3>

<P>Grace allows the user to choose between several output
devices to produce its graphics. The current list of
supported devices is:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> X11</LI>
<LI> PostScript (level 1 and level 2)</LI>
<LI> EPS (encapsulated PostScript)</LI>
<LI> Metafile (which is Grace format, used at the moment mostly
for debugging purposes)</LI>
<LI> MIF (Maker Interchange Format used by FrameMaker)</LI>
<LI> SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics, a language for describing
two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics
in XML)</LI>
<LI> PDF (depends on extra libraries,
see 
<A HREF="#configuration">configuration</A>)</LI>
<LI> PNM (portable anymap file format)</LI>
<LI> JPEG (depends on extra libraries,
see 
<A HREF="#configuration">configuration</A>)</LI>
<LI> PNG (depends on extra libraries,
see 
<A HREF="#configuration">configuration</A>)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Note that Grace no longer supports GIF due to
the copyright policy of Unisys. Grace can also be
instructed to launch conversion programs automatically
based on file name. As an example you can produce MIF
(FrameMaker Interchange Format) or Java applets using
pstoedit, or almost any image format using the netpbm suite
(see the 
<A HREF="FAQ.html">FAQ</A>).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="magic-path"></A> Magic path        </H3>

<P>In many cases, when Grace needs to access a file given with a
relative <CODE>pathname</CODE>, it searches for the file along the
following path:
<CODE>./pathname:./.grace/pathname:~/.grace/pathname:$GRACE_HOME/pathname</CODE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="dynamic-modules"></A> Dynamic modules        </H3>

<P>Grace can access external functions present in either system
or third-party shared libraries or modules specially compiled
for use with it. The term dynamic refers to the possibility
Grace has to open the library at run time to find the code of
the external function, there is no need to recompile Grace
itself (the functions already compiled in Grace are
"statically linked").
<P>
<H3><A NAME="coordinates"></A> Coordinate frames         </H3>

<P>There are two types of coordinates in Grace: the <B>world
coordinates</B> and the <B>viewport coordinates</B>. Points of
data sets are defined in the world coordinates. The viewport
coordinates correspond to the image of the plot drawn on the canvas
(or printed on, say, PS output page). The transformation converting
the world coordinates into the viewport ones is determined by both
the graph type and the axis scaling.
<P>Actually, there is yet another level in the hierarchy of coordinates
- the <B>device coordinates</B>. However, you (as a user of Grace)
should not worry about the latter. The mapping between the viewport
coordinates and the device coordinates is always set in such a way
that the origin of the viewport corresponds to the left bottom corner
of the device page, the smallest of the device dimensions corresponds
to one unit in the viewport coordinates. Oh, and the most important
thing about the viewport -&gt; device transformation is that it is
homotetic, i.e. a square is guaranteed to remain a square, not a
rectangle, a circle remains a circle (not an ellipse) etc.
<H2>3.2 Invocation    </H2>

<P>
<P>
<H3>Operational mode        </H3>

<P>
<P>With respect to the user interface, there are three modes of
operation that Grace can be invoked in. The full-featured GUI-based
version is called <CODE>xmgrace</CODE>. A batch-printing version is
called <CODE>gracebat</CODE>. A command-line interface mode is called
<CODE>grace</CODE>. Usually, a single executable is called in all cases,
with two of the three files being (symbolic) links to a "real" one.

is searched for in the magic path (see
<A HREF="#magic-path">magic path</A>); once found, the rest of the
path is ignored. It's recommended that in the <CODE>gracerc</CODE> file,

"Button" for menu buttons.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For example, in order to make Grace popup the Non-linear curve fitting

<H3><A NAME="read-menu"></A> Read menu       </H3>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="read-sets"></A> Sets          </H3>

<P>Read new sets of data in a graph. A 
<A HREF="#graph-selector">graph selector</A> is used to specify the graph where the
data should go (except when reading block data, which are
copied to graphs later on).
<P>Reading as "Single set" means that if the source contains
only one column of numeric data, one set will be created
using the indices (from 1 to the total number of points) as
abscissas and read values as ordinates and that if the source
contains more than one column of data, the first two numeric
columns will be used. Reading as "NXY" means that the first
numeric column will provide the abscissas and all remaining
columns will provide the ordinates of several sets. Reading
as "Block data" means all column will be read and stored and
that another popup will allow to select the abscissas and
ordinates at will. It should be noted that block data are
stored as long as you do not override them by a new read. You
can still retrieve data from a block long after having closed
all popups, using the 
<A HREF="#set-selector">set          selector</A>.
<P>The set type can be one of the predefined set presentation types
(see 
<A HREF="#sets">sets</A>).
<P>The data source can be selected as "Disk" or "Pipe". In the
first case the text in the "Selection" field is considered to
be a file name (it can be automatically set by the file
selector at the top of the popup). In the latter case the
text is considered to be a command which is executed and
should produce the data on its standard output. On systems
that allows is, the command can be a complete sequence of
programs glued together with pipes.
<P>If the source contains date fields, they should be
automatically detected. Several formats are recognized (see
appendix 
<A HREF="#dates">dates in grace</A>). Calendar
dates are converted to numerical dates upon reading.
<P>The "Autoscale on read" menu controls whether, upon reading in new
sets, which axes of the graph should be autoscaled.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="read-netCDF"></A> NetCDF          </H3>

<H2><A NAME="edit-menu"></A> 4.2 Edit menu    </H2>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="data-sets"></A> Data sets       </H3>

<P>Using the data set popup, you can view the properties of
datasets. This include its type, length, associated comment and
main some statistics (min, max, mean, standard deviation). A
horizontal scrollbar at the bottom allows to get the two last
properties, they are not displayed by default. Also note that if
you find some columns are too narrow to show all significant
digits, you can drag the vertical rules using Shift+Button 2.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="set-operations"></A> Set operations       </H3>

<P>The set operations popup allows you to interact with sets as a
whole. If you want to operate on the data ordering of the sets,
you should use the 
<A HREF="#data-set-operations">data set operations</A> popup from the Data menu. The popup
allows you to select a source (one set within one graph) and a
destination and perform some action upon them (copy, move,
swap). This popup also give you a quick access to several graph
and set selectors if you want to perform some other operation
like hiding a graph or creating a new set from block data.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="arrange-graphs"></A> Arrange graphs       </H3>

<P>This entry fires up a popup to lay out several graphs in a
regular grid given rows and columns. The graphs can be packed
together (either horizontally or vertically). New graphs are
created if needed. An important note is that reducing the number
of graphs never delete any graphs! If you select a 6 by 3 grid
and then reduce it to 5 by 3, you will still have 18 graphs on
your screen, three of them looking strange in the middle of the
other ones. This is a security feature that prevent you from
losing data accepting too quickly a wrong setting. If you really
want to get rid of some of the graphs, you should hide or kill
them using any graph selector you can find around (for example
in the set operations presented above).
<P>If you don't want the regular layout this arrangement gives you,
you can change it afterwards using the mouse (select a graph and
double click on the focus marker, see 
<A HREF="#clicks">clicks and double clicks</A>).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="overlay-graphs"></A> Overlay graphs       </H3>

<P>You can overlay a graph on top of another one. The main use of
this feature is to plot several curves using different scales on
the same (apparently) graph. The main difficulty is to be sure
you operate on the graph you want at all times (you can hide one
for a moment if this becomes too difficult).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="autoscale"></A> Autoscale       </H3>

<P>Using this entry, you can autoscale one graph or all graphs
according to the specified sets only. This is useful if you need
either to have truly comparable graphs despite every one
contains data of different ranges, or if you want to focus your
attention on one set only while it is displayed with other data
in a complex graph.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="regions-menu"></A> Regions menu       </H3>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="status"></A> Status          </H3>

<P>This small popup only displays the current state (type and
whether it is active or not) of the existing regions.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="define"></A> Define          </H3>

<P>You can define a new region (or redefine an existing one),
the allowed region types are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Inside polygon</LI>
<LI> Outside polygon</LI>
<LI> Above line</LI>
<LI> Below line</LI>
<LI> Left of line</LI>
<LI> Right of line</LI>
<LI> In horizontal range</LI>
<LI> In vertical range</LI>
<LI> Out of horizontal range</LI>
<LI> Out of vertical range</LI>
</UL>
<P>A region can be either linked to the current graph only or to
all graphs.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="clear"></A> Clear          </H3>

<P>This kills a region.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="report-on"></A> Report on          </H3>

<P>This popup reports you which sets or points are inside or
outside of a region.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="hot-links"></A> Hot links       </H3>

<P>You can link a set to a file or a pipe using this feature. Once
a link has been established, you can update it (i.e., read data
again) by clicking on the update button. If you have specified a
command (using grace language) in the corresponding text field
of the popup, it will be executed after each update. Note that
you can use several commands separated by ';' characters.
<P>Currently, only simple XY sets can be used for hotlinks.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="set-locator-fixed-point"></A> Set locator fixed point       </H3>

<P>After having selected this menu entry, you can select a point on
a graph that will be used as the origin of the locator display
(just below the menu bar). The fixed point is taken into account
only when the display type of the locator is set to [DX,DY].
<P>
<H3><A NAME="clear-locator-fixed-point"></A> Clear locator fixed point       </H3>

<P>This entry is provided to remove a fixed point set before and
use the default again: point [0, 0].
<P>
<H3><A NAME="locator-props"></A> Locator props       </H3>

<P>The locator props popup allows you to customize the display of
the locator, mainly its type and the format and precision of the
display. You can use all the formats that are allowed in the
graphs scales.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="preferences"></A> Preferences       </H3>

<P>The preferences popup allows you to set miscellaneous properties
of your grace session, such as GUI behavior, cursor type,
date reading hint and reference date used for calendar conversions.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="data-menu"></A> 4.3 Data menu    </H2>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="data-set-operations"></A> Data set operations       </H3>

<P>This popup gathers all operations that are related to the
ordering of data points inside a set or between sets. If you
want to operate on the sets as a whole, you should use the 
<A HREF="#set-operations">set operations</A> popup from the Edit
menu. You can sort according to any coordinate (X, Y, DX, ...)
in ascending or descending order, reverse the order of the
points, join several sets into one, split one set into several
others of equal lengths, or drop a range of points from a
set. The 
<A HREF="#set-selector">set selector</A> of the
popup shows the number of points in each set in square brackets
like this: G0.S0[63], the points are numbered from 0 to n-1.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="transformations-menu"></A> Transformations menu       </H3>

<P>The transformations sub-menu gives you access to all data-mining
features of Grace.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="evaluate-expression"></A> Evaluate expression          </H3>

<P>Using evaluate expression allows you to create a set by
applying an explicit formula to another set, or to parts of
another set if you use regions restrictions.
<P>All the classical mathematical functions are available (cos,
sin, but also lgamma, j1, erf, ...). As usual all
trigonometric functions use radians by default but you can
specify a unit if you prefer to say cos (x rad) or sin (3 * y
deg). Other predefined names include pi (for the constant)
and a, b, c and d for scratch arrays you can use to store
data between evaluations.
<P>In the formula, you can use X, Y, Y1, ..., Y4 to denote any
coordinate you like from the source set. An implicit loop
will be used around your formula so if you say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
         x = x - 4966.5
         
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>you will shift all points of your set 4966.5 units to the left.
<P>You can use more than one set in the same formula, like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
         y = y - 0.653 * sin (x deg) + s2.y
         
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>which means you use both X and Y from the source set but also
the Y coordinate of set 2. Beware that the loop is a simple
loop over the indices, all the sets you use in such an hybrid
expression should therefore have the same number of points
and point i of one set should really be related to point i of
the other set. If your sets do not follow these requirements,
you should first homogenize them using
<A HREF="#interpolation">interpolation</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="histograms"></A> Histograms          </H3>

<P>The histograms popup allows you to compute either standard
or cumulative histograms from the Y coordinates of
your data. You can select only a range using the start and
end fields and you can specify the bin width.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="fourier-transforms"></A> Fourier transforms          </H3>

<P>This popup is devoted to direct and inverse Fourier
transforms. The default is to perform a direct transform on
unfiltered data and to produce a set with the index as
abscissa and magnitude as ordinate. You can filter the input
data window through triangular, Hanning, Welch, Hamming,
Blackman and Parzen filters. You can load magnitude, phase or
coefficients and use either index, frequency or period as
abscissas. You can choose between direct and inverse Fourier
transforms. If you specify real input data, X is assumed to
be equally spaced and ignored; if you specify complex input
data X is taken as the real part and Y as the imaginary part.
<P>If Grace was configured with the FFTW library (see 
<A HREF="#configuration">configuration</A>), then the DFT and
FFT buttons really perform the same transform (so there is no
speed-up in using FFT in this case). If you want Grace can to
use FFTW <I>wisdom</I> files, you should set several 
<A HREF="#environment-variables">environment variables</A> to
name them.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="running-averages"></A> Running averages          </H3>

<P>The running average popup allows you to compute some values
on a sliding window over your data. You choose both the value
you need (average, median, minimum, maximum, standard
deviation) and the length of the window and perform the
operation. You can restrict the operation to the points
belonging to (or outside of) a region.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="differences"></A> Differences          </H3>

<P>The differences popup is used to compute approximations of
the first derivative of a function with finite
differences. The only choice (apart from the source set of
course) is the type of differences to use: forward, backward
or centered.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="seasonal-differences"></A> Seasonal differences          </H3>

<P>The seasonal differences popup is used to subtract data from
a period to data of the preceding period (namely y[i] - y[i +
period]). Beware that the period is entered in terms of index
in the set and not in terms of abscissa!
<P>
<H3><A NAME="integration"></A> Integration          </H3>

<P>The integration popup is used to compute the integral of a
set and optionally to load it. The numerical value of the
integral is shown in the text field after
computation. Selecting "cumulative sum" in the choice item
will create and load a new set with the integral and compute
the end value, selecting "sum only" will only compute the end
value.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="interpolation"></A> Interpolation          </H3>

<P>The interpolation popup is used to force the abscissas of one
set to correspond exactly to the abscissas of another
set. This is mainly used before performing some complex
operations between the two sets with the 
<A HREF="#evaluate-expression">evaluate          expression</A> popup. Several
interpolation methods can be used: linear, spline or Akima
splines. Note that if the interpolated set is not wider than
the reference set, some extremal points will be missing. You
can check this with the number of points of each set (it
appears in the set selectors of the popup). In this case you
can perform a second run interpolating the reference set at
the abscissas of the newly created set, this will remove the
extra points.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="splines"></A> Splines          </H3>

<P>Using the splines popup you can fit a part of a set with
cubic or Akima splines. You select which part you want to
operate on with the start and stop fields, they are both
expressed in abscissa units. The number of points refer to
the spline you want to create.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="regression"></A> Regression          </H3>

<P>The regression popup can be used to fit a set against
polynomials or some specific functions (y=A*x^B,
y=A*exp(B*x), y=A+B*ln(x) and y=1/(A+Bx)) for which a simple
transformation of input data can be used to apply linear
regression formulas.
<P>You can load either the fitted values, the residuals or the
function itself. Choosing to load fitted values or residuals
leads to a set of the same length and abscissas as the
initial set. Choosing to load the function is almost similar
to load the fitted values except that you choose yourself the
boundaries and the number of points. This can be used for
example to draw the curve outside of the data sample range or
to produce an evenly spaced set from an irregular one.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="non-linear-fit"></A> Non-linear fit          </H3>

<P>The non linear fit popup can be used for functions outside of
the simple regression methods scope. With this popup you
provide the expression yourself using a0, a1, ..., a9 to
denote the fit parameters (as an example you can say y = a0 * cos
(a1 * x + a2)). You specify a tolerance, starting values and
optional bounds and run several steps before loading the
results.
<P>The fit characteristics (number of parameters, formula, ...)
can be saved in a file and retrieved as needed using the file
menu of the popup.
<P>In the "Advanced" tab, you can additionally apply a restriction to the
set(s) to be fitted (thus ignoring points not satisfying the
criteria), use one of preset weighting schemes or define your own,
and choose whether to load the fitted values, the residuals or
the function itself. Choosing to load fitted values or residuals leads
to a set of the same length and abscissas as the initial set. Choosing
to load the function is almost similar to load the fitted values
except that you choose yourself the boundaries and the number of
points. This can be used for example to draw the curve outside of the
data sample range or to produce an evenly spaced set from an irregular
one.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="cross/auto-correlation"></A> Cross/auto correlation          </H3>

<P>The correlation popup can be used to compute autocorrelation
of one set or cross correlation between two sets. You only
select the set (or sets) and specify the maximum lag.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="digital-filter"></A> Digital filter          </H3>

<P>You can use a set as a weight to filter another set. Only the
Y part and the length of the weighting set are important, the
X part is ignored.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="linear-convolution"></A> Linear convolution          </H3>

<P>The convolution popup is used to ... convolve two sets. You
only select the sets and apply.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="geometric-transforms"></A> Geometric transforms          </H3>

<P>You can rotate, scale or translate sets using the geometric
transformations popup. You specify the characteristics of
each transform and the application order.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="sample-points"></A> Sample points          </H3>

<P>This popup provides two sampling methods. The first one is
to choose a starting point and a step, the second one is to
select only the points that satisfy a boolean expression you
specify.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="prune-data"></A> Prune data          </H3>

<P>This popup is devoted to reducing huge sets (and then saving
both computation time and disk space).
<P>The interpolation method can be applied only to ordered sets:
it is based on the assumption that if a real point and an
interpolation based on neighboring points are closer than a
specified threshold, then the point is redundant and can be
eliminated.
<P>The geometric methods (circle, ellipse, rectangle) can be
applied to any set, they test each point in turn and keep
only those that are not in the neighborhood of previous
points.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="feature-extraction"></A> Feature extraction       </H3>

<P>Given a set of curves in a graph, extract a feature from each
curve and use the values of the feature to provide the Y values
for a new curve.

<H2><A NAME="plot-menu"></A> 4.4 Plot menu    </H2>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="plot-appearance"></A> Plot appearance       </H3>

<P>The plot appearance popup let you set the time stamp properties
and the background color of the page. The color is used outside
of graphs and also on graphs were no specific background color
is set. The time stamp is updated every time the project is modified.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="graph-appearance"></A> Graph appearance       </H3>

<P>The graph appearance popup can be displayed from both the plot
menu and by double-clicking on a legend, title, or subtitle of a
graph (see 
<A HREF="#clicks">Clicks and double clicks</A>). The graph selector at the top allows to choose
the graph you want to operate on, it also allows certain common
actions through its popup menu (see 
<A HREF="#graph-selector">graph selector</A>). The main tab includes the properties you
will need more often (title for example), and other tabs are
used to fine tune some less frequently used options (fonts,
sizes, colors, placements).
<P>If you need special characters or special formatting in your
title or subtitle, you can use grace escape sequences (the
sequence will appear verbatim in the text field but will be
rendered on the graph), see 
<A HREF="#typesetting">typesetting</A>. If you don't remember the mapping between
alphabetic characters and the glyph you need in some specific
fonts (mainly symbol and zapfdingbats), you can invoke the font
tool from the text field by hitting CTRL-e. You can change fonts
and select characters from there, they will be copied back in
the text field when you press the "Accept" button. Beware of
the position of the cursor as you enter text or change font in
the font tool, the character or command will be inserted at this
position, not at the end of the string!
<P>
<H3><A NAME="set-appearance"></A> Set appearance       </H3>

<P>The set appearance popup can be displayed from both the plot
menu and by double-clicking anywhere in a graph (see 
<A HREF="#clicks">Clicks and double clicks</A>). The set selector
at the top allows to choose the set you want to operate on, it
also allows certain common actions through its popup menu (see
<A HREF="#set-selector">set selector</A>). The main tab
gathers the properties you will need more often (line and
symbol properties or legend string for example), and other tabs
are used to fine tune some less frequently used options (drop
lines, fill properties, annotated values and error bars
properties for example).
<P>You should note that despite the legend string related to
<EM>one</EM> set is entered in the set appearance popup, this is not
sufficient to display it. Displaying <EM>all</EM> legends is a graph
level decision, so the toggle is in the main tab of the 
<A HREF="#graph-appearance">graph appearance</A> popup.
<P>If you need special characters or special formatting in your
legend, you can use grace escape sequences (the sequence will
appear verbatim in the text field but will be rendered on the
graph), see 
<A HREF="#typesetting">typesetting</A>. If you
don't remember the mapping between alphabetic characters and the
glyph you need in some specific fonts (mainly symbol and
zapfdingbats), you can invoke the font tool from the text
field by hitting CTRL-e. You can change fonts and select
characters from there, they will be copied back in the text
field when you press the "Accept" button. Beware of the
position of the cursor as you enter text or change font in the
font tool, the character or command will be inserted at this
position, not at the end of the string!
<P>
<H3><A NAME="axis-properties"></A> Axis properties       </H3>

<P>The axis properties popup can be displayed from both the "Plot"
menu and by double-clicking exactly on an axis (see 
<A HREF="#clicks">Clicks and double clicks</A>). The pulldown menu
at the top allows to select the axis you want to operate on. The
"Active" toggle globally activates or deactivates the axis (all
GUI elements are insensitive for deactivated axes). The start
and stop fields depict the displayed range. Three types of
scales are available: linear, logarithmic or reciprocal, and
you can invert the axis (which normally increases from left to
right and from bottom to top).  The main tab includes the
properties you will need more often (axis label, tick
spacing and format for example), and other tabs are used to fine
tune some less frequently used options (fonts, sizes, colors,
placements, stagger, grid lines, special ticks, ...).
<P>If you need special characters or special formatting in your
label, you can use grace escape sequences (the
sequence will appear verbatim in the text field but will be
rendered on the graph), see 
<A HREF="#typesetting">typesetting</A>. If you don't remember the mapping between
alphabetic characters and the glyph you need in some specific
fonts (mainly symbol and zapfdingbats), you can invoke the font
tool from the text field by hitting CTRL-e. You can change fonts
and select characters from there, they will be copied back in
the text field when you press the "Accept" button. Beware of
the position of the cursor as you enter text or change font in
the font tool, the character or command will be inserted at this
position, not at the end of the string!
<P>Once you have set the options as you want, you can apply
them. One useful feature is that you can set several axes at
once with the bottom pulldown menu (current axis, all axes
current graph, current axis all graphs, all axes all
graphs). Beware that you always apply the properties of all
tabs, not only the selected one.

<P>
<H2>5.1 List selectors       </H2>

<P>Various selectors are available in several popups. They all display
lists of objects (graphs, sets, ...) and can be used to perform
simple operations on these objects (copying, deleting, ...). The
operations are available from a popup menu that appears when pressing
mouse button 3 on them. Depending on the required functionality, they
may allow multiple choices or not. The following
shortcuts are enabled (if the result of an action would contradict the
list's selection policy, this would be ignored):
<UL>
<LI> Ctrl+a select all</LI>
<LI> Ctrl+u unselect all</LI>
<LI> Ctrl+i invert selection</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="graph-selector"></A> Graph selector          </H3>

<P>The operations that can be performed on graphs through the graph
selector's menu popup are:
<UL>
<LI> focus to</LI>
<LI> hide</LI>
<LI> show</LI>
<LI> duplicate</LI>
<LI> kill</LI>
<LI> swap</LI>
<LI> create new</LI>
</UL>

All this operations are not available in every instance of the
selector. For example in the "read sets" popup only one graph can
be selected at a time, and the swap operation is disabled.
<P>Double-clicking on a list entry will switch the focus to that graph.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="set-selector"></A> Set selector          </H3>

<P>The operations that can be performed on sets through the set
selector are:
<UL>
<LI> hide</LI>
<LI> show</LI>
<LI> bring to front</LI>
<LI> send to back</LI>
<LI> duplicate</LI>

<P>
<P>When the pointer focus is on the canvas (where the graph is drawn), there
are some shortcuts to activate several actions. They are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Ctrl &lt;Key&gt;A: Autoscale</LI>
<LI> Ctrl &lt;Key&gt;D: Delete an object</LI>
<LI> Ctrl &lt;Key&gt;L: Move current graph legend</LI>
<LI> Ctrl &lt;Key&gt;M: Move an object</LI>
<LI> Ctrl &lt;Key&gt;T: Place timestamp</LI>
<LI> Ctrl &lt;Key&gt;U: Refresh hotlinks</LI>
<LI> Ctrl &lt;Key&gt;V: Set the viewport with mouse</LI>
<LI> Ctrl &lt;Key&gt;Z: Zoom</LI>
<LI> Ctrl Alt &lt;Key&gt;L: Draw a line</LI>
<LI> Ctrl Alt &lt;Key&gt;B: Draw a box</LI>
<LI> Ctrl Alt &lt;Key&gt;E: Draw an ellipse</LI>
<LI> Ctrl Alt &lt;Key&gt;T: Write a text string</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="clicks"></A> 6.2 Clicks and double clicks    </H2>

<P>
<P>A single click inside a graph switches focus to that graph. This is the
default policy, but it can be changed from the "Edit/Preferences"
popup.
<P>
<P>
<P>Double clicking on parts of the canvas will invoke certain actions
or raise some popups:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> on a focus marker: move selected viewport corner </LI>
<LI> on an axis:  "Axis properties" popup</LI>
<LI> on a set:    "Set appearance" popup</LI>
<LI> on a legend: "Graph appearance" popup</LI>
<LI> on a (sub)title: "Graph appearance" popup</LI>
<LI> on an object (box, line, ...): a popup for editing properties of that object</LI>
</UL>
<P>The double clicking actions can be enabled/disabled from the
"Edit/Preferences" popup.

<H3>Font configuration      </H3>

<P>The file responsible for the font configurations of Grace is
<CODE>fonts/FontDataBase</CODE>. The first line contains a positive integer
specifying the number of fonts declared in that file. All remaining lines
contain declarations of one font each, composed out of three fields:
<OL>
<LI> Font name. The name will appear in the font selector controls.
Also, backend devices that has built-in fonts, will be given the
name as a font identifier.</LI>
<LI> Font fall-back. Grace will try to use this in case the real
font is not found.</LI>
<LI> Font filename. The file with the font outline data.</LI>

<H3>Font data files    </H3>

<P>For text rastering, three types of files are used.
<OL>
<LI> <CODE>.pfa</CODE>-/<CODE>.pfb</CODE>-files: These contain the character
outline descriptions. The files are assumed to be in the
<CODE>fonts/type1</CODE> directory; these are the filenames
specified in the <CODE>FontDataBase</CODE> configuration file.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>.afm</CODE>-files: These contain high-precision font metric
descriptions as well as some extra information, such as kerning
and ligature information for a particular font. It is assumed
that the filename of a font metric file has same basename as the
respective font outline file, but with the <CODE>.afm</CODE>
extension; the metric files are expected to be found in the
<CODE>fonts/type1</CODE> directory, too.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>.enc</CODE>-files: These contain encoding arrays in a special
but simple form. They are only needed if someone wants to load
a special encoding to re-encode a font. Their place is
<CODE>fonts/enc</CODE></LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Custom fonts      </H3>

<P>It is possible to use custom fonts with Grace. One mostly needs to use
extra fonts for the purpose of localization. For many European
languages, the standard fonts supplied with Grace should contain all the
characters needed, but encoding may have to be adjusted. This is done by
putting a <CODE>Default.enc</CODE> file with proper encoding scheme into the
<CODE>fonts/enc</CODE> directory. Grace comes with a few encoding files in
the directory; more can be easily found on the Internet. (If the
<CODE>Default.enc</CODE> file doesn't exist, the IsoLatin1 encoding will be
used). Notice that for fonts having an encoding scheme in themselves
(such as the Symbol font, and many nationalized fonts) the default
encoding is ignored.
<P>If you do need to use extra fonts, you should modify the
<CODE>FontDataBase</CODE> file accordingly, obeying its format. However,
if you are going to exchange Grace project files with other people who
do not have the extra fonts configured, an important thing is to define
reasonable fall-back font names.
<P>For example, let us assume I use Hebrew fonts, and the configuration file
has lines like these:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
    ...
Courier-Hebrew              Courier                 courh___.pfa
Courier-Hebrew-Oblique      Courier-Oblique         courho__.pfa
    ...
      
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

My colleague, who lives in Russia, uses Cyrillic fonts with Grace
configured like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
    ...
Cronix-Courier              Courier                 croxc.pfb
Cronix-Courier-Oblique      Courier-Oblique         croxco.pfb
    ...
      
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The font mapping information (Font name &lt;-&gt; Font fall-back) is
stored in the Grace project files. Provided that all the localized fonts
have English characters in the lower part of the ASCII table unmodified,
I can send my friend files (with no Hebrew characters, of course) and be
sure they render correctly on his computer.
<P>Thus, with properly configured national fonts, you can make localized
annotations for plots intended for internal use of your institution,
while being able to exchange files with colleagues from abroad. People
who ever tried to do this with MS Office applications should appreciate
the flexibility :-).

<P>
<P> There is no fortran equivalent for the GracePrintf function,
you should format all the data and commands yourself before
sending them with GraceCommandF.
<P>The Grace subprocess listen for the commands you send and
interpret them as if they were given in a batch file. You can
send any command you like (redraw, autoscale, ...). If you want
to send data, you should include them in a command like "g0.s0
point 3.5, 4.2".
<P>Apart from the fact it monitors the data sent via an anonymous
pipe, the Grace subprocess is a normal process. You can interact
with it through the GUI. Note that no error can be sent back to
the parent process. If your application send erroneous commands,
an error popup will be displayed by the subprocess.
<P>If you exit the subprocess while the parent process is still
using it, the broken pipe will be detected. An error code will
be returned to every further call to the library (but you can
still start a new process if you want to manage this situation).
<P>Here is an example use of the library, you will find this
program in the distribution.

<H2><A NAME="fftw-tuning"></A> 8.3 FFTW tuning    </H2>

<P>When the FFTW capabilities are compiled in, Grace looks at two environment
variables to decide what to do with the FFTW 'wisdom' capabilities. 
First, a quick summary of what this is. The FFTW package is capable of
adaptively determining the most efficient factorization of a set to give
the fastest computation.  It can store these factorizations as 'wisdom',
so that if a transform of a given size is to be repeated, it is does not
have to re-adapt.  The good news is that this seems to work very well. 
The bad news is that, the first time a transform of a given size is
computed, if it is not a sub-multiple of one already known, it takes a LONG
time (seconds to minutes).
<P>The first environment variable is GRACE_FFTW_WISDOM_FILE. If this is set
to the name of a file which can be read and written (e.g.,
$HOME/.grace_fftw_wisdom) then Grace will automatically create this file
(if needed) and maintain it. If the file is read-only, it will be read,
but not updated with new wisdom. If the symbol GRACE_FFTW_WISDOM_FILE
either doesn't exist, or evaluates to an empty string, Grace will drop the
use of wisdom, and will use the fftw estimator (FFTW_ESTIMATE flag sent to
the planner) to guess a good factorization, instead of adaptively
determining it.
<P>The second variable is GRACE_FFTW_RAM_WISDOM. If this variable is defined
to be non-zero, and GRACE_FFTW_WISDOM_FILE variable is not defined (or is
an empty string), Grace will use wisdom internally, but maintain no
persistent cache of it. This will result in very slow execution times the
first time a transform is executed after Grace is started, but very fast
repeats. I am not sure why anyone would want to use wisdom without
writing it to disk, but if you do, you can use this flag to enable it.

<P>The return values of functions are assumed to be of the
<CODE>double</CODE> type.
<P>Note, that there is no difference from the point of view of
function prototype between parameters and variables; the
difference is in the way Grace treats them - an attempt to use
a vector expression as a parameter argument will result in a
parse error.
<P>Let us consider few examples.
<P>
<H3>Examples       </H3>

<P>Caution: the examples provided below (paths and compiler flags)
are valid for Linux/ELF with gcc. On other operating systems,
you may need to refer to compiler/linker manuals or ask a guru.
<P>
<H3>Example 1       </H3>

<P>Suppose I want to use function <CODE>pow(x,y)</CODE> from the Un*x math
library (libm). Of course, you can use the "^" operator defined
in the Grace language, but here, for the sake of example, we
want to access the function directly.
<P>The command to make it accessible by Grace is
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
USE "pow" TYPE f_of_dd FROM "/usr/lib/libm.so"
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Try to plot y = pow(x,2) and y = x^2 graphs (using, for
example, "create new -&gt; Formula" from any 
<A HREF="#set-selector">set        selector</A>) and compare.
<P>
<H3>Example 2       </H3>

<P>Now, let us try to write a function ourselves. We will define
function <CODE>my_function</CODE> which simply returns its (second)
argument multiplied by integer parameter transferred as the
first argument.
<P>In a text editor, type in the following C code and save it as
"my_func.c":
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
       double my_function (int n, double x)
       {
           double retval;
           retval = (double) n * x;
           return (retval);
       }
       
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>OK, now compile it:
<P>

</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That's all! Ready to make it visible to Grace as "myf" - we are

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
USE "my_function" TYPE f_of_nd FROM "/tmp/my_func.so" ALIAS "myf"
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<H3>Example 3       </H3>

<P>A more serious example. There is a special third-party library
available on your system which includes a very important for
you yet very difficult-to-program from the scratch function
that you want to use with Grace.  But, the function prototype
is NOT one of any predefined 
<A HREF="#grace-types">types</A>.  The solution is to write a simple function
wrapper. Here is how:
<P>Suppose, the name of the library is "special_lib" and the
function you are interested in is called "special_func" and
according to the library manual, should be accessed as <CODE>void
special_func(double *input, double *output, int parameter)</CODE>.
The wrapper would look like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
       double my_wrapper(int n, double x)
       {
           extern void special_func(double *x, double *y, int n);
           double retval;
           (void) special_func(&amp;x, &amp;retval, n);
           return (retval);
       }
       
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Compile it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
       $gcc -c -fPIC my_wrap.c
       $gcc -shared my_wrap.o -o /tmp/my_wrap.so -lspecial_lib -lblas
       $strip /tmp/my_wrap.so
       
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that I added <CODE>-lblas</CODE> assuming that the special_lib
library uses some functions from the BLAS. Generally, you have
to add <I>all</I> libraries which your module depends on (and
all libraries those libraries rely upon etc.), as if you wanted
to compile a plain executable.
<P>Fine, make Grace aware of the new function
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
USE "my_wrapper" TYPE f_of_nd FROM "/tmp/my_wrap.so" ALIAS "special_func"
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>so we can use it with its original name.
<P>
<H3>Example 4       </H3>

<P>An example of using Fortran modules.
<P>Here we will try to achieve the same functionality as in
Example 2, but with the help of F77.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

C
       RETURN
       END
       
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As opposite to C, there is no way to call such a function from
Grace directly - the problem is that in Fortran all arguments
to a function (or subroutine) are passed by reference. So, we
need a wrapper:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
       double myfunc_wrapper(int n, double x)
       {
           extern double myfunc_(int *, double *);
           double retval;
           retval = myfunc_(&amp;n, &amp;x);
           return (retval);
       }
       
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that most of f77 compilers by default add underscore to
the function names and convert all names to the lower case,
hence I refer to the Fortran function <CODE>MYFUNC</CODE> from my C
wrapper as <CODE>myfunc_</CODE>, but in your case it can be different!
<P>Let us compile the whole stuff:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
       $g77 -c -fPIC myfunc.f
       $gcc -c -fPIC myfunc_wrap.c
       $gcc -shared myfunc.o myfunc_wrap.o -o /tmp/myfunc.so -lf2c -lm
       $strip /tmp/myfunc.so
       
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And finally, inform Grace about this new function:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
USE "myfunc_wrapper" TYPE f_of_nd FROM "/tmp/myfunc.so" ALIAS "myfunc"
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Operating system issues         </H3>

<P>
<H3>OS/2          </H3>

<P>In general the method outlined in the examples above can be
used on OS/2, too. However you have to create a
DLL (Dynamic Link Library) which is a bit more tricky on OS/2 than
on some un*x systems. 
This document can't explain the whole procedure in detail but roughly
describes the way to go.
Since Grace was ported with EMX we also use it to create the examples,
however other development environments should work as well.
We refer to Example 2, since Example 1 is showing a problem on OS/2:
DLLs might have their entry points (i.e. exported functions)
callable as ordinals only, so you might not know how to access a
specific function without some research. 
First compile my_func.c to my_func.obj
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
gcc -Zomf -Zmt -c my_func.c
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then you need to create a linker definition file my_func.def which
gives some basic info about the DLL and declares the exported
functions.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
         LIBRARY my_func INITINSTANCE TERMINSTANCE
         CODE LOADONCALL
         DATA LOADONCALL MULTIPLE NONSHARED

         EXPORTS
         my_function
         
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(don't forget about the 8 characters limit on the DLL name!).
Finally link the DLL:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
gcc my_func.obj my_func.def -o my_func.dll -Zdll -Zno-rte -Zmt -Zomf
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(the -Zno-rte flag depends on the content of the library;
check out the EMX documentation about this as well as 
the other compiler/linker flags used here!)
To use these new library function in Grace you may either put the
DLL in the LIBPATH and use the short form:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
USE "my_function" TYPE f_of_nd FROM "my_func" ALIAS "myf"
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or have it in an arbitrary path which you need to specify explicitly
then:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
USE "my_function" TYPE f_of_nd FROM "e:/foo/my_func.dll" ALIAS "myf"

<H2><A NAME="dates"></A> 9.4 Dates in Grace     </H2>

<P>We use two calendars in Grace: the one that was established in
532 by Denys and lasted until 1582, and the one that was created
by Luigi Lilio (Alyosius Lilius) and Christoph Klau
(Christophorus Clavius) for pope Gregorius XIII. Both use the
same months (they were introduced under emperor Augustus, a few
years after Julian calendar introduction, both Julius and
Augustus were honored by a month being named after each one).
<P>The leap years occurred regularly in Denys's calendar: once
every four years, there is no year 0 in this calendar (the leap
year -1 was just before year 1). This calendar was not compliant
with earth motion and the dates were slowly shifting with regard
to astronomical events.
<P>This was corrected in 1582 by introducing Gregorian
calendar. First a ten days shift was introduced to reset correct
dates (Thursday October the 4th was followed by Friday October
the 15th). The rules for leap years were also changed: three
leap years are removed every four centuries. These years are
those that are multiple of 100 but not multiple of 400: 1700,
1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but 1600 and 2000 were (will
be) leap years.
<P>We still use Gregorian calendar today, but we now have several
time scales for increased accuracy. The International Atomic
Time (TAI) is a linear scale: the best scale to use for
scientific reference. The Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, often
confused with Greenwich Mean Time) is a legal time that is
almost synchronized with earth motion. However, since the earth
is slightly slowing down, leap seconds are introduced from time
to time in UTC (about one second every 18 months). UTC is not a
continuous scale ! When a leap second is introduced by
International Earth Rotation Service, this is published in
advance and the legal time sequence is as follows: 23:59:59
followed one second later by 23:59:60 followed one second later
by 00:00:00. At the time of this writing (1999-01-05) the
difference between TAI and UTC was 32 seconds, and the last leap
second was introduced in 1998-12-31.
<P>These calendars allow to represent any date from the mist of the
past to the fog of the future, but they are not convenient for
computation. Another time scale is possible: counting only the
days from a reference. Such a time scale was introduced by
Joseph-Juste Scaliger (Josephus Justus Scaliger) in 1583. He
decided to use "-4713-01-01T12:00:00" as a reference date
because it was at the same time a Monday, first of January of a
leap year, there was an exact number of 19 years Meton cycle
between this date and year 1 (for Easter computation), and it
was at the beginning of a 15 years <I>Roman indiction</I>
cycle. The day number counted from this reference is
traditionally called <I>Julian day</I>, but it has really
nothing to do with the Julian calendar.
<P>Grace stores dates internally as reals numbers counted from a
reference date. The default reference date is the one chosen by
Scaliger, it is a classical reference for astronomical
events. It can modified for a single session using the 
<A HREF="#preferences">Edit-&gt;Preferences</A> popup of the GUI. If
you often work with a specific reference date you can set it for
every sessions with a REFERENCE DATE command in your
configuration file (see 
<A HREF="#default-template">Default template</A>).
<P>The following date formats are supported (hour, minutes and
seconds are always optional):
<P>
<OL>
<LI>iso8601  : 1999-12-31T23:59:59.999</LI>
<LI>european : 31/12/1999 23:59:59.999 or 31/12/99 23:59:59.999</LI>
<LI>us       : 12/31/1999 23:59:59.999 or 12/31/99 23:59:59.999</LI>
<LI>Julian   : 123456.789</LI>
</OL>
<P>One should be aware that Grace does not allow to put a space in
one data column as spaces are used to separate fields. You
should always use another separator (:/.- or better T) between
date and time in data files. The GUI, the batch language and the
command line flags do not have this limitation, you can use
spaces there without any problem. The T separator comes from the
ISO8601 standard. Grace support its use also in european and us
formats.
<P>You can also provide a hint about the format ("ISO8601",
"european", "us") using the -datehint command line flag or the
ref name="Edit->Preferences" id="preferences"> popup of the GUI.
The formats are tried in the following order: first the hint
given by the user, then iso, european and us (there is no
ambiguity between calendar formats and numerical formats and
therefore no order is specified for them). The separators
between various fields can be any characters in the set: " :/.-T"
(one or more spaces act as one separator, other characters can
not be repeated, the T separator is allowed only between date and time,
mainly for iso8601), so the string "1999-12 31:23/59" is allowed
(but not recommended).  The '-' character is used both as a
separator (it is traditionally used in iso8601 format) and as
the unary minus (for dates in the far past or for numerical
dates). By default years are left untouched, so 99 is a date far
away in the past. This behavior can be changed with the 
<A HREF="#preferences">Edit->preferences</A> popup, or with the
<CODE>DATE WRAP on</CODE> and <CODE>DATE WRAP YEAR year</CODE>
commands. Suppose for example that the wrap year is chosen as
1950, if the year is between 0 and 99 and is written with two or
less digits, it is mapped to the present era as follows:
<P>range [00 ; 49] is mapped to [2000 ; 2049]
<P>range [50 ; 99] is mapped to [1950 ; 1999]
<P>with a wrap year set to 1970, the mapping would have been:
<P>range [00 ; 69] is mapped to [2000 ; 2069]
<P>range [70 ; 99] is mapped to [1970 ; 1999]
<P>this is reasonably Y2K compliant and is consistent with current
use.  Specifying year 1 is still possible using more than two
digits as follows: "0001-03-04" is unambiguously March the 4th,
year 1. The inverse transform is applied for dates written by
Grace, for example as tick labels. Using two digits only for
years is not recommended, we introduce a <I>wrap year +
100</I> bug here so this feature should be removed at some
point in the future ...
<P>The date scanner can be used either for Denys's and Gregorian
calendars. Inexistent dates are detected, they include year 0,
dates between 1582-10-05 and 1582-10-14, February 29th of non
leap years, months below 1 or above 12, ...  the scanner does
not take into account leap seconds: you can think it works only
in International Atomic Time (TAI) and not in Coordinated
Unified Time (UTC). If you find yourself in a situation were you
need UTC, a very precise scale, and should take into account
leap seconds ... you should convert your data yourself (for
example using International Atomic Time). But if you bother with
that you probably already know what to do.

<H2>9.5 Xmgr to Grace migration guide    </H2>

<P>
<P>This is a very brief guide describing problems and workarounds for
reading in project files saved with Xmgr. You should read the docs or
just play with Grace to test new features and controls.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Grace must be explicitly told the version number of the software
used to create a file. You can manually put "@version VERSIONID"
string at the beginning of the file. The VERSIONID is built as
MAJOR_REV*10000 + MINOR_REV*100 + PATCHLEVEL; so 40101 corresponds
to xmgr-4.1.1. Projects saved with Xmgr-4.1.2 do NOT need the above,
since they already have the version string in them. If you have no
idea what version of Xmgr your file was created with, try some.
In most cases, 40102 would do the trick.
 </LI>
<LI> The above relates to the ASCII projects only. The old binary
projects (saved with xmgr-4.0.*) are not automatically converted
anymore. An input filter must be defined to make the conversion
work on-the-fly. Add the following line to &nbsp;/.gracerc or the
system-wide $GRACE_HOME/gracerc resource file: DEFINE IFILTER
"grconvert %s -" MAGIC "00000031" See docs for more info on the
I/O filters.
 </LI>
<LI> Documentation on the script language is severely lacking still.
 </LI>
<LI> Grace is WYSIWYG. Xmgr was not. Many changes required to achieve the
WYSIWYG'ness led to the situation when graphs with objects carefully
aligned under Xmgr may not look so under Grace. Grace tries its best
to compensate for the differences, but sometimes you may have to
adjust such graphs manually.
 </LI>
<LI> A lot of symbol types (all except *real* symbols) are removed.
"Location *" types can be replaced (with much higher comfort) by
A(nnotating)values. "Impulse *", "Histogram *" and "Stair steps *"
effects can be achieved using the connecting line parameters (Type,
Drop lines). "Dot" symbol is removed as well; use the filled circle
symbol of the zero size with no outline to get the same effect.
 </LI>
<LI> Default page layout switched from free (allowing to resize canvas
with mouse) to fixed. For the old behavior, put "PAGE LAYOUT FREE"
in the Grace resource file or use the "-free" command line switch.
<B>The use of the "free" page layout is in general deprecated,
though.</B>
 </LI>
<LI> System (shell) variables GR_* renamed to GRACE_*
 </LI>
<LI> Smith plots don't work now. They'll be put back soon.
