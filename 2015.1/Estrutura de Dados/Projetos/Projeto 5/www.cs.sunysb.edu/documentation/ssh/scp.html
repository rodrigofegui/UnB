SCP(1)                         SSH                         SCP(1)



<B>NAME</B>
       scp - secure copy (remote file copy program)


<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
       <B>scp </B>[<B>-prvC</B>] [<B>-P </B><I>port</I>] [<B>-c </B><I>cipher</I>] [<B>-i </B><I>identity</I>]
            [[<B>user@</B>]<B>host1:</B>]<B>filename1</B>...  [[<B>user@</B>]<B>host2:</B>]<B>filename2</B>


<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       <B>Scp </B>copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses  <B>ssh</B>
       for  data  transfer,  and uses the same authentication and
       provides the same security as <B>ssh.  </B>Unlike <B>rcp</B>,  <B>ssh  </B>will
       ask  for  passwords  or passphrases if they are needed for
       authentication.

       Any file name may contain a host and user specification to
       indicate  that the file is to be copied to/from that host.
       Copies between two remote hosts are permitted.


<B>OPTIONS</B>
       <B>-c </B><I>cipher</I>
             Selects the cipher to use for  encrypting  the  data
             transfer.  This option is directly passed to <B>ssh.</B>

       <B>-i </B><I>identity</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>
             Selects  the  file  from which the identity (private
             key) for RSA authentication is read.  This option is
             directly passed to <B>ssh.</B>

       <B>-p    </B>Preserves  modification  times,  access  times,  and
             modes from the original file.

       <B>-r    </B>Recursively copy entire directories.

       <B>-v    </B>Verbose mode.  Causes <B>scp </B>and <B>ssh </B>to print debugging
             messages  about  their progress.  This is helpful in
             debugging connection, authentication, and configura­
             tion problems.

       <B>-B    </B>Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
             passphrases).

       <B>-C    </B>Compression enable.  Passes the -C flag  to  <B>ssh  </B>to
             enable compression.

       <B>-P </B><I>port</I>
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
             Note that this option is written with a  capital  P,
             because  -p  is  already reserved for preserving the
             times and modes of the file in rcp.
