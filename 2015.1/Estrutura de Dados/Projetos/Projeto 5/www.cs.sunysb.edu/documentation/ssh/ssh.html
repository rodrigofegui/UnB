<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       <B>Ssh  </B>(Secure  Shell)  a  program for logging into a remote
       machine and for executing commands in  a  remote  machine.
       It  is  intended  to  replace  rlogin and rsh, and provide
       secure  encrypted  communications  between  two  untrusted
       hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbi­
       trary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over  the  secure
       channel.

       <B>Ssh  </B>connects  and  logs into the specified <I>hostname</I>.  The
       user must prove his/her identity  to  the  remote  machine
       using one of several methods.

       First,  if  the machine the user logs in from is listed in
       <I>/etc/hosts.equiv  </I>or  <I>/etc/shosts.equiv  </I>on   the   remote
       machine,  and  the  user names are the same on both sides,
       the user is immediately permitted to log in.   Second,  if
       <I>.rhosts  </I>or <I>.shosts </I>exists in the user's home directory on
       the remote machine and contains a line containing the name
       of  the  client  machine  and the name of the user on that
       machine, the user is permitted to log in.   This  form  of
       authentication alone is normally not allowed by the server
       because it is not secure.

       The second (and  primary)  authentication  method  is  the
       <B>rhosts  </B>or <B>hosts.equiv </B>method combined with RSA-based host
       authentication.  It means that if the login would be  per­
       mitted   by   <I>.rhosts</I>,   <I>.shosts</I>,   <I>/etc/hosts.equiv,   or</I>
       <I>/etc/shosts.equiv</I>, and  additionally  it  can  verify  the
       client's   host   key   (see   <I>$HOME/.ssh/known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts  </I>and
       <I>/etc/ssh</I><B>_</B><I>known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts </I>in  the  <B>FILES  </B>section),  only  then
       login  is  permitted.   This  authentication method closes
       security holes due to IP spoofing, DNS spoofing and  rout­
       ing     spoofing.     [Note    to    the    administrator:
       <I>/etc/hosts.equiv</I>, <I>.rhosts</I>, and the rlogin/rsh protocol  in
       general, are inherently insecure and should be disabled if
       security is desired.]

       As a third authentication method, <B>ssh </B>supports  RSA  based
       authentication.   The  scheme is based on public-key cryp­
       tography: there are  cryptosystems  where  encryption  and
       decryption  are  done  using  separate keys, and it is not
       possible to derive the decryption key from the  encryption
       key.   RSA is one such system.  The idea is that each user
       creates a public/private key pair for authentication  pur­
       poses.  The server knows the public key, and only the user
       knows  the  private  key.   The   file   <I>$HOME/.ssh/autho­</I>
       <I>rized</I><B>_</B><I>keys  </I>lists  the  public keys that are permitted for
       logging in.  When the user logs in, the <B>ssh </B>program  tells
       the server which key pair it would like to use for authen­
       tication.  The server checks if this key is permitted, and
       if so, sends the user (actually the <B>ssh </B>program running on
       behalf  of  the  user)  a  challenge,  a  random   number,
       encrypted  by  the  user's  public key.  The challenge can
       only be decrypted  using  the  proper  private  key.   The
       user's  client  then decrypts the challenge using the pri­
       vate key, proving that he/she knows the  private  key  but
       without disclosing it to the server.

       <B>Ssh  </B>implements  the RSA authentication protocol automati­
       cally.  The user creates his/her RSA key pair  by  running
       <B>ssh-keygen</B>(1).   This stores the private key in <I>.ssh/iden­</I>
       <I>tity </I>and the public key in <I>.ssh/identity.pub </I>in the user's
       home  directory.   The  user  should  then  copy the <I>iden­</I>
       <I>tity.pub </I>to <I>.ssh/authorized</I><B>_</B><I>keys </I>in his/her home directory
       on  the  remote  machine  (the <I>authorized</I><B>_</B><I>keys </I>file corre­
       sponds to the conventional <I>.rhosts </I>file, and has  one  key
       per line, though the lines can be very long).  After this,
       the user can log in  without  giving  the  password.   RSA
       authentication is much more secure than rhosts authentica­
       tion.

       The most convenient way to use RSA authentication  may  be
       with  an  authentication agent.  See <B>ssh-agent</B>(1) for more
       information.

       As a fourth authentication method, <B>ssh </B>supports  authenti­
       cation through TIS authentication server. The idea is that
       <B>ssh </B>asks TIS <B>authsrv</B>(8) to authenticate  the  user.  Some­
       time,  usernames in the TIS database cannot be the same as
       the local users. This can be the case if the user  authen­
       ticates  itself  with  a  smartcard or a Digipass. In that
       case, the username in the database is usually known as the
       serial  number  of  the  authentification device. The file
       <I>/etc/sshd</I><B>_</B><I>tis.map </I>contains the mapping between local users
       and  their  corresponding name in the TIS database. If the
       file does not exist or the user is not found,  the  corre­
       sponding  name  in  the TIS database is supposed to be the
       same.

       If other authentication methods fail, <B>ssh </B>prompts the user
       for  a  password.  The password is sent to the remote host
       for  checking;  however,  since  all  communications   are
       encrypted,  the password cannot be seen by someone listen­
       ing on the network.

       When the user's identity has been accepted by the  server,
       the server either executes the given command, or logs into
       the machine and gives the  user  a  normal  shell  on  the
       remote machine.  All communication with the remote command
       or shell will be automatically encrypted.

       If a pseudo-terminal has been allocated (normal login ses­
       sion),  the user can disconnect with "~.", and suspend <B>ssh</B>
       with "~^Z".  All forwarded connections can be listed  with
       "~#",  and if the session blocks waiting for forwarded X11
       or TCP/IP connections to terminate, it can be backgrounded
       with "~&amp;" (this should not be used while the user shell is
       active, as it can cause the shell to hang).  All available
       escapes can be listed with "~?".

       A  single  tilde character can be sent as "~~" (or by fol­
       lowing the tilde by a character other than those described
       above).  The escape character must always follow a newline
       to be interpreted as special.  The escape character can be
       changed in configuration files or on the command line.

       If no pseudo tty has been allocated, the session is trans­
       parent and can be used to reliably transfer  binary  data.
       On  most systems, setting the escape character to ``none''
       will also make the session transparent even if  a  tty  is
       used.

       The session terminates when the command or shell in on the
       remote machine exists and all X11 and  TCP/IP  connections
       have  been  closed.  The exit status of the remote program
       is returned as the exit status of <B>ssh.</B>

       If the user is using X11 (the <B>DISPLAY </B>environment variable
       is  set),  the  connection to the X11 display is automati­
       cally forwarded to the remote side in such a way that  any
       X11  programs  started from the shell (or command) will go
       through the encrypted channel, and the connection  to  the
       real  X  server  will be made from the local machine.  The
       user should not manually set <B>DISPLAY</B>.  Forwarding  of  X11
       connections  can  be  configured on the command line or in
       configuration files.

       The DISPLAY value set by <B>ssh  </B>will  point  to  the  server
       machine,  but  with  a  display  number greater than zero.
       This is normal, and happens because <B>ssh </B>creates a  "proxy"
       X  server on the server machine for forwarding the connec­
       tions over the encrypted channel.

       <B>Ssh </B>will also automatically set up Xauthority data on  the
       server machine.  For this purpose, it will generate a ran­
       dom authorization cookie, store it in  Xauthority  on  the
       server,  and  verify  that any forwarded connections carry
       this cookie and replace it by the  real  cookie  when  the
       connection  is  opened.  The real authentication cookie is
       never sent to the server machine (and no cookies are  sent
       in the plain).

       If  the user is using an authentication agent, the connec­
       tion to the agent is automatically forwarded to the remote
       side unless disabled on command line or in a configuration
       file.

       Forwarding of arbitrary TCP/IP connections over the secure
       channel  can  be  specified either on command line or in a
       configuration file.  One possible  application  of  TCP/IP
       forwarding  is a secure connection to an electronic purse;
       another is going trough firewalls.

       <B>Ssh </B>automatically maintains and checks a database contain­
       ing  RSA-based  identifications  for all hosts it has ever
       been   used   with.    The   database   is    stored    in
       <I>.ssh/known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts  </I>in the user's home directory.  Addition­
       ally,  the  file  <I>/etc/ssh</I><B>_</B><I>known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts  </I>is   automatically
       checked  for known hosts.  Any new hosts are automatically
       added to the user's file.  If a host's identification ever
       changes,  <B>ssh  </B>warns  about  this  and  disables  password
       authentication to prevent a trojan horse from getting  the
       user's  password.  Another purpose of this mechanism is to
       prevent man-in-the-middle attacks which could otherwise be
       used  to  circumvent  the  encryption.  The <B>StrictHostKey­</B>
       <B>Checking </B>option (see below) can be used to prevent  logins
       to machines whose host key is not known or has changed.



<B>OPTIONS</B>
       <B>-a     </B>Disables  forwarding  of  the  authentication agent
              connection.  This may also be specified on  a  per-
              host basis in the configuration file.

       <B>-c </B><I>idea</I>|<I>des</I>|<I>3des</I>|<I>blowfish</I>|<I>arcfour</I>|<I>none</I>
              Selects  the  cipher to use for encrypting the ses­
              sion.  <B>idea </B>is used by default.  It is believed  to
              be  secure.   <B>des  </B>is the data encryption standard,
              but is breakable  by  governments,  large  corpora­
              tions,  and  major  criminal  organizations.   <B>3des</B>
              (triple-des) is encrypt-decrypt-encrypt triple with
              three different keys.  It is presumably more secure
              than DES.  It is used as default if both  sites  do
              not  support IDEA.  <B>blowfish </B>is an encryption algo­
              rithm invented by Bruce Schneier.  It uses 128  bit
              keys.   <B>arcfour  </B>is  an  algorithm published in the
              Usenet News in 1995.  This algorithm is believed to
              be  equivalent  with  the  RC4 cipher from RSA Data
              Security (RC4 is a trademark of RSA Data Security).
              This  is the fastest algorithm currently supported.
              <B>none  </B>disables  encryption  entirely;  it  is  only
              intended  for debugging, and it renders the connec­
              tion insecure.

       <B>-e </B><I>ch</I>|<I>^ch</I>|<I>none</I>
              Sets the escape character for sessions with  a  pty
              (default:  ~).  The escape character is only recog­
              nized at the beginning of a line.  The escape char­
              acter  followed by a dot (.) closes the connection,
              followed by control-Z suspends the connection,  and
              followed by itself sends the escape character once.
              Setting  the  character  to  ´none´  disables   any
              escapes and makes the session fully transparent.

       <B>-f     </B>Requests  ssh to go to background after authentica­
              tion is done and forwardings have been established.
              This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords
              or passphrases, but the user wants it in the  back­
              ground.   This may also be useful in scripts.  This
              implies <B>-n.  </B>The recommended way to start X11  pro­
              grams  at a remote site is with something like "ssh
              -f host xterm".

       <B>-i </B><I>identity</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>
              Selects the file from which the  identity  (private
              key)  for  <B>RSA  </B>authentication is read.  Default is
              <I>.ssh/identity </I>in the user's home directory.   Iden­
              tity  files  may  also  be  specified on a per-host
              basis in the configuration file.  It is possible to
              have  multiple  -i options (and multiple identities
              specified in configuration files).

       <B>-k     </B>Disables forwarding of the kerberos tickets.   This
              may  also  be  specified on a per-host basis in the
              configuration file.

       <B>-l </B><I>login</I><B>_</B><I>name</I>
              Specifies the user to  log  in  as  on  the  remote
              machine.   This may also be specified on a per-host
              basis in the configuration file.

       <B>-n     </B>Redirects stdin from /dev/null (actually,  prevents
              reading from stdin).  This must be used when <B>ssh </B>is
              run in the background.  A common trick  is  to  use
              this  to run X11 programs in a remote machine.  For
              example, "ssh -n shadows.cs.hut.fi  emacs  &amp;"  will
              start  an  emacs  on shadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11
              connection will be automatically forwarded over  an
              encrypted  channel.  The <B>ssh </B>program will be put in
              the background.  (This does not work if  <B>ssh  </B>needs
              to  ask  for a password or passphrase; see also the
              -f option.)

       <B>-o </B><I>'option'</I>
              Can be used to give options in the format  used  in
              the  config  file.   This  is useful for specifying
              options for which there is no separate command-line
              flag.   The option has the same format as a line in
              the configuration file.

       <B>-p </B><I>port</I>
              Port to connect to on the remote host.  This can be
              specified  on a per-host basis in the configuration
              file.

       <B>-q     </B>Quiet mode.  Causes all warning and diagnostic mes­
              sages to be suppressed.  Only fatal errors are dis­
              played.

       <B>-P     </B>Use non privileged port. With this you  cannot  use
              rhosts  or rsarhosts authentications, but it can be
              used to bypass some firewalls that dont allow priv­
              ileged source ports to pass.

       <B>-t     </B>Force  pseudo-tty  allocation.  This can be used to
              execute arbitary screen-based programs on a  remote
              machine,  which can be very useful e.g. when imple­
              menting menu services.

       <B>-v     </B>Verbose mode.  Causes <B>ssh </B>to print  debugging  mes­
              sages  about  its  progress.   This  is  helpful in
              debugging connection, authentication, and  configu­
              ration problems.

       <B>-V     </B>Print only version number and exit.

       <B>-g     </B>Allows  remote hosts to connect local port forward­
              ing ports. The default is that only  localhost  may
              connect to locally binded ports.

       <B>-x     </B>Disables  X11  forwarding.  This can also be speci­
              fied on a per-host basis in a configuration file.

       <B>-C     </B>Requests compression of all data (including  stdin,
              stdout,  stderr,  and  data  for  forwarded X11 and
              TCP/IP connections).  The compression algorithm  is
              the  same used by gzip, and the "level" can be con­
              trolled by the <B>CompressionLevel </B>option (see below).
              Compression  is  desirable on modem lines and other
              slow connections, but will only slow down things on
              fast  networks.   The default value can be set on a
              host-by-host basis in the configuration files;  see
              the <B>Compress </B>option below.

       <B>-L </B><I>port:host:hostport</I>
              Specifies that the given port on the local (client)
              host is to be forwarded to the given host and  port
              on  the  remote  side.   This works by allocating a
              socket to listen to <B>port </B>on  the  local  side,  and
              whenever  a  connection  is  made to this port, the
              connection is forwarded over  the  secure  channel,
              and  a connection is made to <B>host:hostport </B>from the
              remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be spec­
              ified  in  the  configuration  file.  Only root can
              forward privileged ports.

       <B>-R </B><I>port:host:hostport</I>
              Specifies  that  the  given  port  on  the   remote
              (server)  host is to be forwarded to the given host
              and port on the local side.  This works by allocat­
              ing  a socket to listen to <B>port </B>on the remote side,
              and whenever a connection is made to this port, the
              connection  is  forwarded  over the secure channel,
              and a connection is made to <B>host:hostport </B>from  the
              local machine.  Port forwardings can also be speci­
              fied in the configuration file.   Privileged  ports
              can  be  forwarded  only when logging in as root on
              the remote machine.


<B>CONFIGURATION FILES</B>
       <B>Ssh </B>obtains configuration data from the following  sources
       (in  this  order): command line options, user's configura­
       tion file (<I>$HOME/.ssh/config</I>), and system-wide  configura­
       tion  file  (<I>/etc/ssh</I><B>_</B><I>config</I>).   For  each  parameter, the
       first obtained value  will  be  used.   The  configuration
       files contain sections bracketed by "Host" specifications,
       and that section is only applied for hosts that match  one
       of  the  patterns given in the specification.  The matched
       host name is the one given on the command line.

       Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used,
       more  host-specific  declarations should be given near the
       beginning of the file, and general defaults at the end.

       The configuration file has the following format:

              Empty lines and lines starting with  ´#´  are  com­
              ments.

              Otherwise  a  line  is of the format "keyword argu­
              ments" or "keyword = arguments".  The possible key­
              words  and their meanings are as follows (note that
              the configuration  files  are  case-sensitive,  but
              keywords are case-insensitive):


       <B>Host   </B>Restricts  the  following  declarations  (up to the
              next <B>Host </B>keyword) to be only for those hosts  that
              match  one of the patterns given after the keyword.
              ´*´ and ´?´ can be as wildcards in the patterns.  A
              single  ´*´  as  a  pattern  can be used to provide
              global defaults for all hosts.   The  host  is  the
              <I>hostname  </I>argument given on the command line (i.e.,
              the name is not converted to a  canonicalized  host
              name before matching).


       <B>BatchMode</B>
              If  set to "yes", passphrase/password querying will
              be disabled.  This option is useful in scripts  and
              other  batch  jobs where you have no user to supply
              the password.  The argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or  "<B>no</B>".


       <B>Cipher </B>Specifies  the  cipher  to  use  for encrypting the
              session.  Currently,  <I>idea</I>,  <I>des</I>,  <I>3des</I>,  <I>blowfish</I>,
              <I>arcfour</I>,  and  <I>none  </I>are supported.  The default is
              "idea" (or "3des" if "idea"  is  not  supported  by
              both  hosts).   Using  "none"  (no  encryption)  is
              intended only for debugging, and  will  render  the
              connection insecure.


       <B>ClearAllForwardings</B>
              Clears  all  forwardings  after  reading all config
              files and parsing command line. This is usefull  to
              disable forwardings in config file when you want to
              make second connection to host  having  forwardings
              in  config  file. Scp sets this on by default so it
              will not fail even if you have some forwardings set
              in config file.


       <B>Compression</B>
              Specifies whether to use compression.  The argument
              must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>CompressionLevel</B>
              Specifies the compression level to use if  compres­
              sion  is  enable.   The argument must be an integer
              from 1 (fast) to 9 (slow, best).  The default level
              is  6,  which  is  good for most applications.  The
              meaning of the values is the same as in GNU GZIP.


       <B>ConnectionAttempts</B>
              Specifies the number of tries (one per  second)  to
              make  before  falling  back to rsh or exiting.  The
              argument must be an integer.  This may be useful in
              scripts if the connection sometimes fails.


       <B>EscapeChar</B>
              Sets the escape character (default: ~).  The escape
              character can also be set on the command line.  The
              argument should be a single character, ´^´ followed
              by a letter, or  ``none''  to  disable  the  escape
              character entirely (making the connection transpar­
              ent for binary data).


       <B>FallBackToRsh</B>
              Specifies that if connecting via <B>ssh </B>fails due to a
              connection  refused error (there is no <B>sshd </B>listen­
              ing on the remote host), <B>rsh  </B>should  automatically
              be used instead (after a suitable warning about the
              session being unencrypted).  The argument  must  be
              "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>ForwardAgent</B>
              Specifies whether the connection to the authentica­
              tion agent (if any) will be forwarded to the remote
              machine.  The argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>ForwardX11</B>
              Specifies whether X11 connections will be automati­
              cally redirected over the secure channel  and  <B>DIS­</B>

              <B>PLAY </B>set.  The argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>GatewayPorts</B>
              Specifies  that  also  remote  hosts may connect to
              locally forwarded  ports.   The  argument  must  be
              "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>GlobalKnownHostsFile</B>
              Specifies    a    file    to    use    instead   of
              <I>/etc/ssh</I><B>_</B><I>known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts</I>.


       <B>HostName</B>
              Specifies the real host name to log into.  This can
              be  used  to  specify nicnames or abbreviations for
              hosts.  Default is the name given  on  the  command
              line.   Numeric  IP  addresses  are  also permitted
              (both on the command line and in <B>HostName  </B>specifi­
              cations).


       <B>IdentityFile</B>
              Specifies  the  file  from  which  the  user's  RSA
              authentication identity is read (default <I>.ssh/iden­</I>
              <I>tity  </I>in the user's home directory).  Additionally,
              any identities represented  by  the  authentication
              agent  will  be  used for authentication.  The file
              name may use the tilde syntax to refer to a  user's
              home  directory.   It  is possible to have multiple
              identity files specified  in  configuration  files;
              all these identities will be tried in sequence.


       <B>KeepAlive</B>
              Specifies  whether the system should send keepalive
              messages to the other  side.   If  they  are  sent,
              death  of  the  connection  or  crash of one of the
              machines will be properly noticed.   However,  this
              means  that  connections  will  die if the route is
              down temporarily, and some people find it annoying.

              The  default is "yes" (to send keepalives), and the
              client will notice if the network goes down or  the
              remote  host  dies.   This is important in scripts,
              and many users want it too.

              To disable keepalives, the value should be  set  to
              "no"  in  both the server and the client configura­
              tion files.


       <B>KerberosAuthentication</B>
              Specifies whether Kerberos V5  authentication  will
              be used.


       <B>KerberosTgtPassing</B>
              Specifies  whether  a  Kerberos V5 TGT will be for­
              warded to the server.


       <B>LocalForward</B>
              Specifies that a TCP/IP port on the  local  machine
              be  forwarded  over  the  secure  channel  to given
              host:port from the remote machine.  The first argu­
              ment  must be a port number, and the second must be
              host:port.  Multiple forwardings may be  specified,
              and additional forwardings can be given on the com­
              mand line.  Only the root  can  forward  privileged
              ports.


       <B>NumberOfPasswordPrompts</B>
              Specifies  number of password prompts before giving
              up. The argument to  must  be  integer.  Note  that
              server  also  limits  number of attempts (currently
              5), so setting this larger doesn't have any effect.
              Default value is one.


       <B>PasswordAuthentication</B>
              Specifies  whether  to use password authentication.
              The argument to this keyword must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>PasswordPromptHost</B>
              Specifies  whether  to include the remote host name
              in the password prompt.  The argument to this  key­
              word must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>PasswordPromptLogin</B>
              Specifies  whether to include the remote login name
              in the password prompt.  The argument to this  key­
              word must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>Port   </B>Specifies  the port number to connect on the remote
              host.  Default is 22.


       <B>ProxyCommand</B>
              Specifies the command to  use  to  connect  to  the
              server.   The  command string extends to the end of
              the line, and is executed  with  /bin/sh.   In  the
              command  string, %h will be substituted by the host
              name to connect and %p by the  port.   The  command
              can be basically anything, and should read from its
              stdin and write to its stdout.  It  should  eventu­
              ally   connect  an  <B>sshd  </B>server  running  on  some
              machine, or execute "sshd -i" somewhere.  Host  key
              management  will  be done using the HostName of the
              host being connected (defaulting to the name  typed
              by the user).

              Note that <B>ssh </B>can also be configured to support the
              SOCKS system using  the  --with-socks4  or  --with-
              socks5 compile-time configuration option.


       <B>RemoteForward</B>
              Specifies  that a TCP/IP port on the remote machine
              be forwarded  over  the  secure  channel  to  given
              host:port  from the local machine.  The first argu­
              ment must be a port number, and the second must  be
              host:port.   Multiple forwardings may be specified,
              and additional forwardings can be given on the com­
              mand  line.   Only  the root can forward privileged


              ports.


       <B>RhostsAuthentication</B>
              Specifies whether to try rhosts  based  authentica­
              tion.   Note that this declaration only affects the
              client side and has no effect whatsoever  on  secu­
              rity.   Disabling  rhosts authentication may reduce
              authentication time on slow connections when rhosts
              authentication  is  not  used.  Most servers do not
              permit  RhostsAuthentication  because  it  is   not
              secure (see RhostsRSAAuthentication).  The argument
              to this keyword must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>RhostsRSAAuthentication</B>
              Specifies whether to try rhosts  based  authentica­
              tion  with  RSA  host  authentication.  This is the
              primary authentication method for most sites.   The
              argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>RSAAuthentication</B>
              Specifies  whether  to try RSA authentication.  The
              argument to this keyword must  be  "<B>yes</B>"  or  "<B>no</B>".
              RSA  authentication  will  only be attempted if the
              identity file exists, or an authentication agent is
              running.


       <B>StrictHostKeyChecking</B>
              If  this  flag  is set to "yes", <B>ssh </B>ssh will never
              automatically    add    host    keys     to     the
              <I>$HOME/.ssh/known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts </I>file, and refuses to connect
              hosts whose host key has  changed.   This  provides
              maximum  protection  against  trojan horse attacks.
              However, it can be somewhat annoying if  you  don't
              have  good <I>/etc/ssh</I><B>_</B><I>known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts </I>files installed and
              frequently connect new hosts. Basically this option
              forces the user to manually add any new hosts. Nor­
              mally this option is set to "ask",  and  new  hosts
              will automatically be added to the known host files
              after you have confirmed  you  really  want  to  do
              that.  If  this  is  set to "no" then new host will
              automatically be added to the known host files. The
              host keys of known hosts will be verified automati­
              cally in either case.

              The argument must be "<B>yes</B>", "<B>no</B>" or "<B>ask</B>".


       <B>TISAuthentication</B>
              Specifies whether to try TIS  authentication.   The
              argument to this keyword must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>UsePrivilegedPort</B>
              Specifies  whether to use privileged port when con­
              necting to other end. The default is yes if  rhosts
              or rsarhosts authentications are enabled.


       <B>User   </B>Specifies  the user to log in as.  This can be use­
              ful if you have a different user name in  different
              machines.   This  saves  the  trouble  of having to

              remember to give the user name on the command line.


       <B>UserKnownHostsFile</B>
              Specifies    a    file    to    use    instead   of
              <I>$HOME/.ssh/known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts</I>.


       <B>UseRsh </B>Specifies that rlogin/rsh should be used  for  this
              host.  It is possible that the host does not at all
              support the <B>ssh </B>protocol.  This causes <B>ssh </B>to imme­
              diately  exec <B>rsh.  </B>All other options (except <B>Host­</B>
              <B>Name</B>) are ignored if this has been specified.   The
              argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>XAuthLocation</B>
              Specifies the path to xauth program.


<B>ENVIRONMENT</B>
       <B>Ssh </B>will normally set the following environment variables:

       <B>DISPLAY</B>
              The DISPLAY variable indicates the location of  the
              X11  server.   It  is  automatically  set by <B>ssh </B>to
              point to a value of  the  form  "hostname:n"  where
              hostname  indicates  the host where the shell runs,
              and n is an integer &gt;= 1.  Ssh  uses  this  special
              value  to  forward  X11 connections over the secure
              channel.  The user should normally not set  DISPLAY
              explicitly,  as that will render the X11 connection
              insecure (and will require  the  user  to  manually
              copy any required authorization cookies).

       <B>HOME   </B>Set to the path of the user's home directory.

       <B>LOGNAME</B>
              Synonym  for  USER; set for compatibility with sys­
              tems that use this variable.

       <B>MAIL   </B>Set to point the user's mailbox.

       <B>PATH   </B>Set to the default PATH, as specified when  compil­
              ing  <B>ssh  </B>or,  on some systems, <I>/etc/environment </I>or
              <I>/etc/default/login</I>.

       <B>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</B>
              if exists, is used to indicate the path of a  unix-
              domain  socket used to communicate with the authen­
              tication agent (or its local representative).

       <B>SSH_CLIENT</B>
              Identifies the client end of the  connection.   The
              variable  contains  three  space-separated  values:
              client ip-address, client port number,  and  server
              port number.

       <B>SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND</B>
              This  will be the original command line of given by
              protocol if forced command is run. It can  be  used
              to fetch arguments etc from the other end.

       <B>SSH_TTY</B>
              This  is  set  to  the name of the tty (path to the
              device)  associated  with  the  current  shell   or
              command.   If  the current session has no tty, this
              variable is not set.

       <B>TZ     </B>The timezone variable is set to indicate  the  pre­
              sent  timezone  if  it  was set when the daemon was
              started (e.i., the daemon passes the  value  on  to
              new connections).

       <B>USER   </B>Set to the name of the user logging in.

       Additionally,     <B>ssh     </B>reads    <I>/etc/environment    </I>and
       <I>$HOME/.ssh/environment</I>, and adds lines of the format  <I>VAR­</I>
       <I>NAME=value  </I>to  the  environment.   Some  systems may have
       still additional mechanisms for setting  up  the  environ­
       ment, such as <I>/etc/default/login </I>on Solaris.


<B>FILES</B>
       <I>$HOME/.ssh/known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts</I>
              Records host keys for all hosts the user has logged
              into (that are not in  <I>/etc/ssh</I><B>_</B><I>known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts</I>).   See
              <B>sshd </B>manual page.

       <I>$HOME/.ssh/random</I><B>_</B><I>seed</I>
              Used for seeding the random number generator.  This
              file contains sensitive data and should  read/write
              for  the  user and not accessible for others.  This
              file is created the first time the program  is  run
              and  updated  automatically.  The user should never
              need to read or modify this file.

       <I>$HOME/.ssh/identity</I>
              Contains the RSA  authentication  identity  of  the
              user.  This file contains sensitive data and should
              be readable by the user but not accessible by  oth­
              ers.   It  is possible to specify a passphrase when
              generating the key; the passphrase will be used  to
              encrypt the sensitive part of this file using <B>IDEA</B>.

       <I>$HOME/.ssh/identity.pub</I>
              Contains the public key for authentication  (public
              part  of the identity file in human-readable form).
              The contents  of  this  file  should  be  added  to
              <I>$HOME/.ssh/authorized</I><B>_</B><I>keys  </I>on  all  machines where
              you wish to log in using RSA authentication.   This
              file  is  not  sensitive  and can (but need not) be
              readable by anyone.  This file is never used  auto­
              matically and is not necessary; it is only provided
              for the convenience of the user.

       <I>$HOME/.ssh/config</I>
              This is the per-user configuration file.  The  for­
              mat  of this file is described above.  This file is
              used by the <B>ssh </B>client.  This file does not usually
              contain  any  sensitive information, but the recom­
              mended permissions are read/write for the user, and
              not accessible by others.

       <I>$HOME/.ssh/authorized</I><B>_</B><I>keys</I>
              Lists  the RSA keys that can be used for logging in
              as this user.  The format of this file is described
              in  the <B>sshd </B>manual page.  In the simplest form the
              format is the same as the .pub identity files (that
              is,  each line contains the number of bits in modu­
              lus, public exponent, modulus, and comment  fields,
              separated  by  spaces).   This  file  is not highly
              sensitive,  but  the  recommended  permissions  are
              read/write for the user, and not accessible by oth­
              ers.

       <I>/etc/ssh</I><B>_</B><I>known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts</I>
              Systemwide list of  known  host  keys.   This  file
              should  be  prepared by the system administrator to
              contain the public host keys of all machines in the
              organization.   This file should be world-readable.
              This file contains public keys, one  per  line,  in
              the  following format (fields separated by spaces):
              system name, number  of  bits  in  modulus,  public
              exponent,  modulus,  and  optional  comment  field.
              When different names are used for the same machine,
              all  such names should be listed, separated by com­
              mas.  The format is described on  the  <B>sshd  </B>manual
              page.

              The  canonical  system  name  (as  returned by name
              servers) is used by <B>sshd </B>to verify the client  host
              when logging in; other names are needed because <B>ssh</B>
              does not convert the user-supplied name to a canon­
              ical  name before checking the key, because someone
              with access to the name servers would then be  able
              to fool host authentication.

       <I>/etc/ssh</I><B>_</B><I>config</I>
              Systemwide  configuration file.  This file provides
              defaults for those values that are not specified in
              the  user's configuration file, and for those users
              who do not have a configuration  file.   This  file
              must be world-readable.

       <I>$HOME/.rhosts</I>
              This file is used in .rhosts authentication to list
              the host/user pairs that are permitted to  log  in.
              (Note  that  this  file  is also used by rlogin and
              rsh, which makes using this file  insecure.)   Each
              line  of  the  file  contains  a  host name (in the
              canonical form returned by name servers), and  then
              a  user  name  on  that host, separated by a space.
              This file must be owned by the user, and  must  not
              have write permissions for anyone else.  The recom­
              mended permission is read/write for the  user,  and
              not accessible by others.

              Note that by default <B>sshd </B>will be installed so that
              it  requires  successful  RSA  host  authentication
              before  permitting .rhosts authentication.  If your
              server machine does not have the client's host  key
              in   <I>/etc/ssh</I><B>_</B><I>known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts</I>,  you  can  store  it  in
              <I>$HOME/.ssh/known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts</I>.  The easiest way to do this
              is  to  connect  back to the client from the server
              machine using ssh; this will automatically add  the
              host key in <I>$HOME/.ssh/known</I><B>_</B><I>hosts</I>.

       <I>$HOME/.shosts</I>
              This  file is used exactly the same way as .rhosts.
              The purpose for having this file is to be  able  to
              use  rhosts authentication with <B>ssh </B>without permit­
              ting login with rlogin or rsh.

       <I>/etc/hosts.equiv</I>
              This file is used  during  .rhosts  authentication.
              It  contains  canonical  hosts  names, one per line
              (the full format is described on  the  <B>sshd  </B>manual
              page).   If  the client host is found in this file,
              login is automatically  permitted  provided  client
              and  server user names are the same.  Additionally,
              successful  RSA  host  authentication  is  normally
              required.   This  file  should  only be writable by
              root.

       <I>/etc/shosts.equiv</I>
              This file is processed exactly as <I>/etc/hosts.equiv</I>.
              This  file may be useful to permit logins using <B>ssh</B>
              but not using rsh/rlogin.

       <I>/etc/sshrc</I>
              Commands in this file are executed by <B>ssh </B>when  the
              user  logs in just before the user's shell (or com­
              mand) is started.  See the  <B>sshd  </B>manual  page  for
              more information.

       <I>$HOME/.ssh/rc</I>
              Commands  in this file are executed by <B>ssh </B>when the
              user logs in just before the user's shell (or  com­
              mand)  is  started.   See  the <B>sshd </B>manual page for
              more information.


<B>INSTALLATION</B>
       <B>Ssh </B>is normally installed as suid  root.   It  needs  root
       privileges  only for rhosts authentication (rhosts authen­
       tication requires that the connection  must  come  from  a
       privileged  port, and allocating such a port requires root
       privileges).   It  also  needs  to   be   able   to   read
       <I>/etc/ssh</I><B>_</B><I>host</I><B>_</B><I>key  </I>to perform <B>RSA </B>host authentication.  It
       is possible to use <B>ssh </B>without root privileges, but rhosts
       authentication will then be disabled.  <B>Ssh </B>drops any extra
       privileges immediately after the connection to the  remote
       host has been made.

       Considerable  work  has  been  put into making <B>ssh </B>secure.
       However, if you find a security problem, please report  it
       immediately to &lt;ssh-bugs@cs.hut.fi&gt;.
