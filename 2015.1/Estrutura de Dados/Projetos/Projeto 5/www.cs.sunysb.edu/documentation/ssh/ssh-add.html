SSH-ADD(1)                     SSH                     SSH-ADD(1)



<B>NAME</B>
       ssh-add - adds identities for the authentication agent


<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
       <B>ssh-add </B>[<B>-p</B>] [<B>-l</B>] [<B>-d</B>] [<B>-D</B>] [<B>file</B>...]


<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       <B>Ssh-add  </B>adds identities to the authentication agent, <B>ssh-</B>
       <B>agent.  </B>When run  without  arguments,  it  adds  the  file
       <I>$HOME/.ssh/identity</I>.   Alternative file names can be given
       on the command line.  If any file requires  a  passphrase,
       <B>ssh-add  </B>asks for the passphrase from the user.  If the -p
       option is given then the passphrase is  read  from  stdin,
       otherwise  if  the  user  is  using X11, the passphrase is
       requested using a small X11 program; otherwise it is  read
       from  the user's tty.  (Note: it may be necessary to redi­
       rect stdin from /dev/null to get the passphrase  requested
       using X11.)

       The  authentication  agent  must be running and must be an
       ancestor of the current process for <B>ssh-add </B>to work.


<B>OPTIONS</B>
       <B>-p   </B>Read passphrase from stdin (or pipe).

       <B>-l   </B>Lists all identities  currently  represented  by  the
            agent.

       <B>-d   </B>Instead  of adding the identity, removes the identity
            from the agent.

       <B>-D   </B>Deletes all identities from the agent.


<B>RETURN STATUS</B>
       <B>Ssh-add </B>returns one of the following exit statuses.  These
       may be useful in scripts.

       0      The requested operation was performed successfully.

       1      No connection could be made to  the  authentication
              agent.  Presumably there is no authentication agent
              active in the execution environment of <B>ssh-add.</B>

       2      The user did not supply a required passphrase.

       3      An identify file could not be found, was not  read­
              able, or was in bad format.

       4      The agent does not have the requested identity.

       5      An unspecified error has occurred; this is a catch-
              all for errors not listed above.


<B>FILES</B>
       <I>$HOME/.ssh/identity</I>
              Contains the RSA  authentication  identity  of  the
              user.   This  file should not be readable by anyone
              but  the  user.   It  is  possible  to  specify   a
              passphrase when generating the key; that passphrase
              will be used to encrypt the private  part  of  this
              file.   This  is  the default file added by <B>ssh-add</B>
              when no other files have been specified.

              If <B>ssh-add </B>needs a passphrase,  it  will  read  the
              passphrase  from the current terminal if it was run
              from a terminal.  If <B>ssh-add </B>does not have a termi­
              nal  associated with it but DISPLAY is set, it will
              open an X11 window to read the passphrase.  This is
              particularly  useful  when  calling  <B>ssh-add </B>from a
              .Xsession or related script.  (Note  that  on  some
              machines  it may be necessary to redirect the input
              from /dev/null to make this work.)
