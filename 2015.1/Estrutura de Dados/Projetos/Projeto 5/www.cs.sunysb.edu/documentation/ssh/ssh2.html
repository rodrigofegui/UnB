<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       <B>Ssh2 </B>(Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote
       machine and executing commands in a remote machine.  It is
       intended  to  replace  rlogin and rsh, and provide secure,
       encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts  over
       an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
       ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

       <B>Ssh2 </B>connects and logs into the specified  <I>hostname</I>.   The
       user  must  prove his identity to the remote machine using
       some authentication method.

       Public key authentication is based on the use  of  digital
       signatures.  Each user creates a public / private key pair
       for authentication purposes. The server knows  the  user's
       public  key,  and  only  the user has the private key. The
       filenames of private keys that are used in  authentication
       are  set  in  <I>$HOME/.ssh2/identification.   </I>When  the user
       tries  to  authenticate   himself,   the   server   checks
       <I>$HOME/.ssh2/authorization </I>for filenames of matching public
       keys and sends a challenge to the user end.  The  user  is
       authenticated  by  signing the challenge using the private
       key. See the <B>FILES </B>section below for more  information  on
       identification and authorization files.

       Private  /  public  key pairs can be created with <B>ssh-key­</B>
       <B>gen2</B>(1).  See <B>ssh-agent2</B>(1) for information on how to  use
       public key authentication in conjunction with an authenti­
       cation agent.

       If other authentication methods fail, <B>ssh2 </B>will prompt for
       a  password.  Since  all communications are encrypted, the
       password will not be available for eavesdroppers.

       When the user's identity has been accepted by the  server,
       the server either executes the given command, or logs into
       the machine and gives the  user  a  normal  shell  on  the
       remote machine.  All communication with the remote command
       or shell will be automatically encrypted.

       If no pseudo tty has been allocated, the session is trans­
       parent and can be used to reliably transfer binary data.

       The session terminates when the command or shell in on the
       remote machine exits and all X11  and  TCP/IP  connections
       have  been  closed.  The exit status of the remote program
       is returned as the exit status of <B>ssh2.</B>

       If the user is using X11 (the <B>DISPLAY </B>environment variable
       is  set),  the  connection to the X11 display is automati­
       cally forwarded to the remote side in such a way that  any
       X11  programs  started from the shell (or command) will go
       through the encrypted channel, and the connection  to  the
       real  X  server  will be made from the local machine.  The
       user should not manually set <B>DISPLAY</B>.  Forwarding  of  X11
       connections  can  be  configured on the command line or in
       configuration files.

       The <B>DISPLAY </B>value set by <B>ssh2 </B>will  point  to  the  server
       machine,  but  with  a  display  number greater than zero.
       This is normal, and happens because <B>ssh2 </B>creates a "proxy"
       X  server on the server machine for forwarding the connec­
       tions over the encrypted channel.

       <B>Ssh2 </B>will also automatically set up the Xauthority data on
       the  server machine.  For this purpose, it will generate a
       random authorization cookie, store it  in  the  Xauthority
       data  on the server, and verify that any forwarded connec­
       tions carry this cookie  and  replace  it  with  the  real
       cookie  when the connection is opened.  The real authenti­
       cation cookie is never sent to the server machine (and  no
       cookies are sent in the plain).

       If  the user is using an authentication agent, the connec­
       tion to the agent is automatically forwarded to the remote
       side  unless disabled on the command line or in a configu­
       ration file.

       Forwarding of arbitrary TCP/IP connections over the secure
       channel  can be specified either on the command line or in
       a configuration file.  TCP/IP forwarding can be  used  for
       secure  connections  to  electronic  purses  or  for going
       through firewalls.

       <B>Ssh2 </B>automatically maintains and checks  a  database  con­
       taining  the  host  public keys. When logging on to a host
       for the first time, the host's public key is stored  in  a
       file  <I>.ssh2/hostkey</I><B>_</B><I>PORTNUMBER</I><B>_</B><I>HOSTNAME.pub  </I>in the user's
       home directory.  If a host's identification changes,  <B>ssh2</B>
       issues  a warning and disables the password authentication
       in order to prevent a Trojan horse from getting the user's
       password.  Another purpose of this mechanism is to prevent
       man-in-the-middle attacks which could otherwise be used to
       circumvent the encryption.

       <B>Ssh2 </B>has built-in support for SOCKS version 4 for travers­
       ing firewalls.  See <B>ENVIRONMENT</B>.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
       <B>-l </B><I>login</I><B>_</B><I>name</I>
              Specifies the user for login to the remote machine.

       <B>-n     </B>Redirect  input  from  /dev/null,  ie.  don't  read
              stdin. This option can also  be  specified  in  the
              configuration file.

       <B>+a     </B>Enable authentication agent forwarding. (default)

       <B>-a     </B>Disable authentication agent forwarding.

       <B>+x     </B>Enable X11 connection forwarding. (default)

       <B>-x     </B>Disable X11 connection forwarding.

       <B>-i </B><I>file</I>
              Specifies  the identity file for public key authen­
              tication. This option can also be specified in  the
              configuration file.

       <B>-F </B><I>file</I>
              Specifies an alternative configuration file to use.
              NOTE:  <I>$HOME/.ssh2/ssh2</I><B>_</B><I>config   </I>is   still   read,
              options  specified here will be used in addition to
              those.

       <B>-t     </B>For tty allocation, ie. allocate a tty  even  if  a
              command is given. This option can also be specified
              in the configuration file.

       <B>-v     </B>Enable verbose mode. Display verbose debugging mes­
              sages.  Equal  to  `-d  2'. This option can also be
              specified in the configuration file.

       <B>-d </B><I>debug</I><B>_</B><I>level</I>
              Print  extensive  debug  information   to   stderr.
              debug_level is either a number, from 0 to 99, where
              99 specifies that all debug information  should  be
              displayed, or a comma-separated list of assignments
              "<B>ModulePattern=debug_level</B>".

       <B>-V     </B>Display version string.

       <B>-q     </B>Make <B>ssh2 </B>quiet, so that  it  doesn't  display  any
              warning messages. This option can also be specified
              in the configuration file.

       <B>-f </B>[<I>o</I>] Fork into  background  after  authentication.  This
              option  can  also be specified in the configuration
              file. Implies '-S' and '-n'. With this option, <B>ssh2</B>
              stays  in  the  background, waiting for connections
              indefinitely (it has to be killed for  it  to  stop
              listening).  With an optional `o' argument, it goes
              to ``one-shot'' mode, which  means  that  once  all
              channels are closed, <B>ssh2 </B>exits.

       <B>-e </B><I>char</I>
              Set  the escape character. Use ``none'' to disable.
              This option can also be specified in the configura­
              tion file. (default; ~)

       <B>-c </B><I>cipher</I>
              Select   the   encryption  algorithm.  Multiple  -c
              options are allowed and a single -c flag  can  have
              only  one cipher. This option can also be specified
              in the configuration file. You  can  use  blowfish,
              twofish, cast, arcfour, and 3des.

       <B>-m </B><I>MAC </I>Select  the MAC (Message Authentication Code) algo­
              rithm. Multiple -m options are allowed and a single
              -m flag can have only one MAC. This option can also
              be specified in the configuration file.

       <B>-p </B><I>port</I>
              Port to connect to on the remote host. This  option
              can also be specified in the configuration file.

       <B>-S     </B>Don't  request  a session channel. This can be used
              with port-forwarding requests if a session  channel
              (and  tty) isn't needed, or the server doesn't give


              one.

       <B>-L </B><I>port:host:hostport</I>
              Specifies that the given port on the local (client)
              host  is to be forwarded to the given host and port
              on the remote side.  This  works  by  allocating  a
              socket to be listened <B>port </B>on the local side. When­
              ever a connection is made to this port, the connec­
              tion  is  forwarded  over  the secure channel and a
              connection is made to <B>host:hostport </B>from the remote
              machine.  Port forwardings can also be specified in
              the configuration  file.   Only  root  can  forward
              privileged ports.

       <B>-R </B><I>port:host:hostport</I>
              Specifies   that  the  given  port  on  the  remote
              (server) host is to be forwarded to the given  host
              and port on the local side.  This works by allocat­
              ing a socket to listen to <B>port </B>on the remote  side,
              and whenever a connection is made to this port, the
              connection is forwarded over  the  secure  channel,
              and  a connection is made to <B>host:hostport </B>from the
              local machine.  Privileged ports can  be  forwarded
              only when logging in as root on the remote machine.

       <B>+C     </B>Enable compression.

       <B>-C     </B>Disable compression. (default)

       <B>-o </B><I>'option'</I>
              Can be used to specify options in the  format  used
              in  the  configuration  files.   This is useful for
              specifying options for which there are no  separate
              command-line flags.  The option has the same format
              as a line in the configuration file.  Comment lines
              are not currently accepted via this option.

       <B>-h     </B>Display a short help on command-line options.


<B>CONFIGURATION FILES</B>
       <B>Ssh2 </B>obtains configuration data from the following sources
       (in this order): system's global configuration file (typi­
       cally  <I>/etc/ssh2/ssh2</I><B>_</B><I>config</I>),  user's  configuration file
       (<I>$HOME/.ssh2/ssh2</I><B>_</B><I>config</I>) and the  command  line  options.
       For each parameter, the last obtained value will be effec­
       tive.

       For format of <I>ssh2</I><B>_</B><I>config</I>, see <B>ssh2_config</B>(5).



       <B>ESCAPE SEQUENCES</B>


       <B>Ssh2 </B>supports escape sequeneces that enable  you  to  have
       some  managability  with  the  session.  In  order for any
       escape sequences to take effect, you  will  need  to  have
       entered  a  newline  character  (read: press return before
       actually doing any of these). What you need  to  do  after
       that is manually enter the characters (for example, a new­
       line, a tidle ~, and the  appropriate  character  for  the
       appropriate task).



       <B>~.     </B>Terminate the connection.

       <B>~^Z    </B>Suspend the session (press control-Z, not ^ and Z).

       <B>~~     </B>Send the escape character.

       <B>~#     </B>List forwarded connections (Not yet implemented).

       <B>~-     </B>Disable the escape character's ability to cancel.

       <B>~&amp;     </B>Backgroun ssh (when waiting for connections to ter­
              minate).

       <B>~?     </B>See a summary of escape sequences.

       <B>~r     </B>Initialiates rekeying manually.

       <B>~s     </B>Give  all  sorts  of  statistics on the connection,
              including server and client  version,  compression,
              PIPO (packets in, packets out), compression, public
              key exchange  algorithms,  and  symmetric  ciphers.
              Much more useful for troubleshooting.

       <B>~V     </B>Dump  the  client  version number to stderr (useful
              for troubleshooting).



       <B>ENVIRONMENT</B>

       <B>Ssh2 </B>will normally set  the  following  environment  vari­
       ables:

       <B>DISPLAY</B>
              The  <B>DISPLAY </B>variable indicates the location of the
              X11 server.  It is automatically  set  by  <B>ssh2  </B>to
              point  to  a  value  of the form "<B>hostname:n</B>" where
              hostname indicates the host where the  shell  runs,
              and  n  is an integer &gt;= 1.  <B>Ssh2 </B>uses this special
              value to forward X11 connections  over  the  secure
              channel.   The user should normally not set <B>DISPLAY</B>
              explicitly, as that will render the X11  connection
              insecure  (and  will  require  the user to manually
              copy any required authorization cookies).


       <B>HOME   </B>Set to the path of the user's home directory.

       <B>LOGNAME</B>
              Synonym for <B>USER</B>; set for compatibility  with  sys­
              tems using this variable.

       <B>MAIL   </B>Set to point the user's mailbox.

       <B>PATH   </B>Set  to the default PATH, as specified when compil­
              ing <B>ssh2 </B>or, on some systems,  <I>/etc/environment  </I>or
              <I>/etc/default/login</I>.

       <B>SSH_SOCKS_SERVER</B>
              If  SOCKS is used, it is configured with this vari­
              able.  The format of the variable is  <I>socks://user­</I>
              <I>name@socks</I><B>_</B><I>server:port/network/netmask,network/net­</I>
              <I>mask ...  </I>for example by setting environment  vari­
              able      <B>SSH_SOCKS_SERVER     </B>to     <I>socks://mylo­</I>
              <I>gin@socks.ssh.com:1080/203.123.0.0/16,198.74.23.0/24</I>
              uses  host  <I>socks.ssh.com  </I>port  <I>1080 </I>as your SOCKS
              server if connection is attempted outside  of  net­
              works  <I>203.123.0.0  </I>(16 bit domain) and <I>198.74.23.0</I>
              (8 bit domain) which are connected directly.

              A default value for <B>SSH_SOCKS_SERVER  </B>variable  can
              be  specified at compile time by specifying <B>--with-</B>
              <B>socks-server=VALUE </B>on the  configure  command  line
              when compiling <B>ssh2</B>.  The default value can be can­
              celled by  setting  <B>SSH_SOCKS_SERVER  </B>to  an  empty
              string,  and overridden by setting <B>SSH_SOCKS_SERVER</B>
              to a new value.  If the  <B>SSH_SOCKS_SERVER  </B>variable
              is set, it should almost always contain local loop­
              back network (127.0.0.0/8) as network that is  con­
              nected directly.

       <B>SSH2_AUTH_SOCK</B>
              If  this exists, it is used to indicate the path of
              a unix-domain socket used to communicate  with  the
              authentication agent (or its local representative).

       <B>SSH2_CLIENT</B>
              Identifies the client end of the  connection.   The
              variable  contains  three  space-separated  values:
              client ip-address, client port number,  and  server
              port number.

       <B>SSH2_ORIGINAL_COMMAND</B>
              This  will be the original command given to <B>ssh2 </B>if
              a forced command is run. It can be  used  to  fetch
              arguments  etc.   from the other end. This does not
              have to be a real command, it can be a  name  of  a
              file, device, parameters or anything else.

       <B>SSH2_TTY</B>
              This  is  set  to  the name of the tty (path to the
              device) associated with the current shell  or  com­
              mand.   If  the  current  session  has no tty, this
              variable is not set.

       <B>TZ     </B>The timezone variable is set to indicate  the  pre­
              sent  timezone  if  it  was set when the daemon was
              started (the daemon passes the value to new connec­
              tions).

       <B>USER   </B>Set to the name of the user logging in.

       Additionally,     <B>ssh2    </B>reads    <I>/etc/environment    </I>and
       <I>$HOME/.ssh2/environment</I>, and adds lines of the format <I>VAR­</I>
       <I>NAME=value  </I>to  the  environment.   Some  systems may have
       still additional mechanisms for setting  up  the  environ­
       ment, such as <I>/etc/default/login </I>on Solaris.


<B>FILES</B>
       <I>$HOME/.ssh2/random</I><B>_</B><I>seed</I>
              Used for seeding the random number generator.  This
              file contains sensitive data  and  its  permissions
              should be 'read/write' for the user and 'not acces­
              sible' for others.  This file is created the  first
              time the program is run and it is updated automati­
              cally.  The user should never need to read or  mod­
              ify this file.

       <I>$HOME/.ssh2/ssh2</I><B>_</B><I>config</I>
              This  is the per-user configuration file.  The for­
              mat of this file is described above.  This file  is
              used  by  the <B>ssh2 </B>client.  This file does not usu­
              ally contain any  sensitive  information,  but  the
              recommended  permissions  are  'read/write' for the
              user, and

       <I>$HOME/.ssh2/identification</I>
              contains information on  how  the  user  wishes  to
              authenticate  himself  when  contacting  a specific
              host.

              The identification file has the same general syntax
              as  the configuration files. The following keywords
              may be used:

       <B>IdKey  </B>This is followed by the filename of a  private  key
              in  the  <I>$HOME/.ssh2 </I>directory used for identifica­
              tion when contacting a host.   If  there  are  more
              than  one <B>IdKeys </B>, they are tried in the order that
              they appear in the identification file.

       <B>PgpSecretKeyFile</B>
              This is followed by  the  filename  of  the  user's
              OpenPGP  private  keyring in the <I>$HOME/.ssh2 </I>direc­
              tory.  OpenPGP keys  listed  after  this  line  are
              expected  to be found from this file.  Keys identi­
              fied with "<B>IdPgpKey*</B>"-keywords are used  like  ones
              identified with "<B>IdKey</B>"-keyword.

       <B>IdPgpKeyName</B>
              This is followed by the OpenPGP key name of the key
              in <B>PgpSecretKeyFile </B>file.

       <B>IdPgpKeyFingerprint</B>
              This is followed by the OpenPGP key fingerprint  of
              the key in <B>PgpSecretKeyFile </B>file.

       <B>IdPgpKeyFingerprint</B>
              This  is  followed by the OpenPGP key id of the key
              in <B>PgpSecretKeyFile </B>file.


       <I>$HOME/.ssh2/authorization</I>
              contains information on how the server will  verify
              the identity of an user.

              The  authorization file has the same general syntax
              as the configuration files. The following  keywords
              may be used:

       <B>Key    </B>This is followed by the filename of a public key in
              the <I>$HOME/.ssh2 </I>directory that is used for  identi­
              fication  when  contacting  the host.  If there are
              more than one key,  they  are  all  acceptable  for
              login.

       <B>PgpPublicKeyFile</B>
              This  is  followed  by  the  filename of the user's
              OpenPGP public keyring  in  <I>$HOME/.ssh2  </I>directory.
              OpenPGP keys listed after this line are expected to
              be found from  this  file.   Keys  identified  with
              "<B>PgpKey*</B>"-keywords  are  used  like ones identified
              with "<B>Key</B>"-keyword.

       <B>PgpKeyName</B>
              This is followed by the OpenPGP key name.

       <B>PgpKeyFingerprint</B>
              This is followed by the OpenPGP key fingerprint.

       <B>PgpKeyId</B>
              This is followed by the OpenPGP key id.

       <B>Command</B>
              This keyword, if used, must  follow  the  "<B>Key</B>"  or
              "<B>PgpKey*</B>"  keyword above. This is used to specify a
              "forced command"  that  will  be  executed  on  the
              server  side instead of anything else when the user
              is authenticated. The command supplied by the  user
              (if   any)  is  put  in  the  environment  variable
              "<B>SSH2_ORIGINAL_COMMAND</B>". The command is  run  on  a
              pty  if the connection requests a pty; otherwise it
              is run without a tty. A quote may  be  included  in
              the  command  by  quoting it with a backslash. This
              option might be useful for restricting certain pub­
              lic  keys  to perform just a specific operation. An
              example might be a key that permits remote  backups
              but  nothing else. Notice that the client may spec­
              ify TCP/IP and/or X11 forwardings, unless they  are
              explicitly prohibited.


       <I>$HOME/.ssh2/hostkeys/key</I><B>_</B><I>xxxx</I><B>_</B><I>yyyy.pub</I>
              These  files  are  the public keys of the hosts you
              connect to. These are updated automatically, unless
              you  have  set <B>StrictHostKeyChecking </B>to "<B>yes</B>". If a
              host's key changes, you should  put  here  the  new
              key. (But don't do that, unless you can be sure the
              key is valid, ie. that no man-in-the-middle  attack
              has  occurred!)   The  "<I>xxxx</I>"  is  the  port on the
              server, where <B>sshd2 </B>runs, and  the  "<I>yyyy</I>"  is  the
              host (specified on command-line).


       <I>/etc/ssh2/hostkeys/key</I><B>_</B><I>xxxx</I><B>_</B><I>yyyy.pub</I>
              If   a  host  key  is  not  found  from  the  users
              "<I>$HOME/.ssh2/hostkeys</I>" directory, this is the  next
              location  to  be  checked.  These  files have to be
              updated manually; no files are put  here  automati­
              cally.


       <I>$HOME/.rhosts</I>
              This  file  contains host-username pairs, separated
              by a space, one per line.  The given  user  on  the
              corresponding  host  is permitted to log in without
              password.  The same file is  used  by  rlogind  and
              rshd.   <B>sshd2 </B>differs from rlogind and rshd in that
              it requires public host key authentication in addi­
              tion  to  validating  the  host name retrieved from
              domain name servers. The file must be writable only
              by  the  user;  it  is  recommended  that it not be
              accessible by others.

              It is also possible to use netgroups in  the  file.
              Either  host  or  user  name  may  be  of  the form
              +@groupname to specify all hosts or  all  users  in
              the group.

       <I>$HOME/.shosts</I>
              For  <B>ssh2,  </B>this  file  is  exactly the same as for
              .rhosts.  However, this file is not used by  rlogin
              and  rshd,  so using this permits access using <B>ssh2</B>
              only.

       <I>/etc/hosts.equiv</I>
              This file is used  during  .rhosts  authentication.
              In  its  simplest  form,  this  file  contains host
              names, one per line.  Users on those hosts are per­
              mitted  to log in without a password, provided that
              they have the same user name on both machines.  The
              host name may also be followed by a user name; such
              users are permitted to log in as <B>any </B>user  on  this
              machine  (except  root).   Additionally, the syntax
              +@group can be used to specify netgroups.   Negated
              entries start with ´-´.

              If  the client host/user is successfully matched in
              this file, login is automatically  permitted,  pro­
              vided that the client and server user names are the
              same.  Additionally,  successful  public  key  host
              authentication  is  normally  required.   This file
              must be writable only by root;  it  is  recommended
              that it be world-readable.

              <B>Warning: It is almost never a good idea to use user</B>
              <B>names in hosts.equiv.  </B>Note that this really  means
              that  the  named  user(s)  can  log  in as <B>anybody</B>,
              including bin, daemon, adm, and other accounts that
              own  critical  binaries  and  directories.  Using a
              user name practically grants the user root  access.
              The only valid use for user names should be in neg­
              ative entries.  <B>Note that this warning also applies</B>
              <B>to rsh/rlogin.</B>

       <I>/etc/shosts.equiv</I>
              This  is  processed  exactly  as  <I>/etc/hosts.equiv.</I>
              However, this file may be  useful  in  environments
              that want to run both rsh/rlogin and <B>ssh2.</B>


       <I>$HOME/.ssh2/knownhosts/xxxxyyyy.pub</I>
              These  are the public hostkeys of hosts that a user
              wants to log from using  "<B>hostbased</B>"-authentication
              (equivalent  with  ssh1's <B>RhostsRSAAuthentication</B>).
              Also, a user has to set  up  her/his  <I>$HOME/.shosts</I>
              (which only ssh uses) or <I>$HOME/.rhosts </I>file.  (This
              is insecure, as  the  file  is  used  also  by  the
              r*-commands.)   If  username  is  the  same in both
              hosts, it is adequate to put the public hostkey  to
              <I>/etc/ssh2/knownhosts  </I>and  add  the  host's name to
              <I>/etc/shosts.equiv </I>(or <I>/etc/hosts.equiv</I>).

              xxxx denotes the hostname (FQDN) and yyyy the  pub­
              lickey algorithm of the key.

              For  example,  zappa.foo.fi's  hostkey algorithm is
              ssh-dss.    The    hostkey    would    be     named
              "<I>zappa.foo.fi.ssh-dss.pub</I>" in the knownhosts-direc­
              tory.

              Possible names for publickey-algorithms  are  "<B>ssh-</B>
              <B>dss</B>" and "<B>ssh-rsa</B>" (without the quotes).


       <I>/etc/ssh2/knownhosts/xxxxyyyy.pub</I>
              As  above,  but  system-wide. These settings can be
              overridden by the user by putting a file  with  the
              same   name   to   her/his   <I>$HOME/.ssh2/knownhosts</I>
              directory.
