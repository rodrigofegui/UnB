SSH2_CONFIG(5)                 SSH2                SSH2_CONFIG(5)



<B>NAME</B>
       ssh2_config - format of configuration file for ssh2


<B>CONFIGURATION FILES</B>
       <B>Ssh2 </B>obtains configuration data from the following sources
       (in this order): system's global configuration file (typi­
       cally  <I>/etc/ssh2/ssh2</I><B>_</B><I>config</I>),  user's  configuration file
       (<I>$HOME/.ssh2/ssh2</I><B>_</B><I>config</I>) and the  command  line  options.
       For each parameter, the last obtained value will be effec­
       tive.


       The configuration file has the following format:

              `expression:' denotes the start of a per-host  con­
              figuration  block,  where  `expression' is an arbi­
              trary string which distinguishes  this  block  from
              others. The `expression' can contain wildcards. The
              `expression' will be  compared  with  the  hostname
              obtained  from the command-line, and if it matches,
              the block will be evaluated.  Evaluation  stops  at
              the  next `expression:' statement. If more than one
              match is found, all will be evaluated and the  last
              obtained  values  for parameters will be effective.
              Note that the `expression' doesn't  have  to  be  a
              real  hostname,  as  long as the `expression' block
              contains a "Host"  configuration  parameter,  where
              the real hostname to connect is defined.

              Empty lines and lines starting with ´#´ are ignored
              as comments.

              Otherwise a line is of the  format  "keyword  argu­
              ments".  Note  that it is possible to enclose argu­
              ments in quotes, and use the standard C convention.
              The  possible  keywords  and  their meanings are as
              follows (note  that  the  configuration  files  are
              case-sensitive, but keywords are case-insensitive):


       <B>AllowedAuthentications</B>
              This keyword specifies the authentications  methods
              that  are  allowed.  This is a comma-separated list
              currently consisting of the following words:  <B>pass­</B>
              <B>word,  publickey  </B>and <B>hostbased</B>.  Each specifies an
              authentication  method.  The   default   is   "<B>pub­</B>
              <B>lickey,password</B>".  The  authentication  methods are
              tried in the order in which they are specified with
              this  configuration  parameter. That means that the
              least interactive methods should be placed first in
              this  list, for example "<B>hostbased, publickey,pass­</B>
              <B>word</B>"  (because  publickey  authentication  can  be
              automated by the user, with <B>ssh-agent</B>).


       <B>AuthenticationSuccessMsg</B>
              Specifies  whether  to display "<I>Authentication suc­</I>
              <I>cessful.</I>" after authentication has  completed  suc­
              cessfully.  This  is  mainly  to  prevent malicious
              servers from getting information from the  user  by
              displaying  additional  pass{word,phrase}  prompts.
              The argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".  The default is
              "<B>yes</B>".


       <B>AuthorizationFile</B>
              Specifies  the  name  of  the  user's authorization
              file.


       <B>BatchMode</B>
              If set to "<B>yes</B>", <B>ssh2 </B>disables password/passhphrase
              querying. This is useful in scripts and other batch
              jobs where you don't have  a  user  to  supply  the
              password.  If the "<B>StrictHostKeyChecking</B>" parameter
              is set to "<B>ask</B>", <B>ssh2  </B>assumes  a  "<B>no</B>"  answer  to
              queries  (this  is  because ssh doesn't even try to
              get user input when invoked with "<B>BatchMode  yes</B>").
              The argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>Ciphers</B>
              Specifies  the  ciphers  to  use for encrypting the
              session. Currently, <I>des</I>,  <I>3des</I>,  <I>blowfish</I>,  <I>arcfour</I>
              <I>twofish </I>and <I>cast </I>are supported, of which <I>des</I>, <I>3des</I>,
              <I>arcfour</I>, <I>blowfish </I>and <I>twofish </I>are included  in  all
              distributions. Multiple ciphers can be specified as
              a comma-separated list.   Special  values  to  this
              option  are  <I>any</I>, <I>anystd</I>, that allows only standard
              (see below)  ciphers,  and  <I>anycipher  </I>that  allows
              either   any  available  cipher  or  excludes  non-
              encrypting cipher mode <I>none </I>but allows all  others.
              <I>anystdcipher  </I>is  the  same  as above, but includes
              only those ciphers  mentioned  in  the  IETF-SecSH-
              draft (excluding '<B>none</B>').


       <B>Compression</B>
              Specifies  whether to use compression. The argument
              must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>DefaultDomain</B>
              This option is only useful if  set  in  the  global
              configuration  file.  This is used by <B>ssh2 </B>and <B>ssh-</B>
              <B>signer2 </B>to find out the system name,  if  only  the
              base part of the system name is available by normal
              means (those used by e.g.  <B>hostname</B>(1)).   This  is
              appended  to  the  found system name, if the system
              name returned doesn't contain a dot ('.').


       <B>DontReadStdin</B>
              Redirect  input  from  /dev/null,  ie.  don't  read
              stdin. The argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>EscapeChar</B>
              Sets the escape character (default: ~).  The escape
              character can also be set on the command line.  The
              argument should be a single character, ´^´ followed
              by a letter, or "<B>none</B>" to disable the escape  char­
              acter  entirely  (making the connection transparent
              for binary data).


       <B>ForcePTTYAllocation</B>
              For tty allocation. Ie. allocate a tty  even  if  a
              command  is  given.  The  argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or
              "<B>no</B>".  (not yet implemented)


       <B>ForwardAgent</B>
              Specifies whether the connection to the authentica­
              tion agent (if any) will be forwarded to the remote
              machine. The argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>ForwardX11</B>
              Specifies whether X11 connections will be automati­
              cally  redirected  over the secure channel and DIS­
              PLAY set.  The argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>GatewayPorts</B>
              Specifies that also remote  hosts  may  connect  to
              locally forwarded ports. The argument must be "<B>yes</B>"
              or "<B>no</B>".  The default is "<B>no</B>".


       <B>GoBackground</B>
              Requests <B>ssh2 </B>to go to background after authentica­
              tion  is  done and the forwardings have been estab­
              lished. This is useful if <B>ssh2 </B>is going to ask  for
              passwords  or passphrases, but the user wants it in
              the background. The argument must be "<B>yes</B>", "<B>no</B>" or
              "<B>oneshot</B>".  With  "<B>oneshot</B>",  <B>ssh2 </B>behaves the same
              way as with  `<B>-f  </B><I>o</I>'  commandline  arguments.   The
              default is "<B>no</B>".


       <B>Host   </B>Specifies  the  real  host  name  to log into. With
              `expression' above, this can  be  used  to  specify
              nicknames  or  abbreviations for hosts. The default
              is the name given on the command line.  Numeric  IP
              addresses  are  also permitted (both on the command
              line and in HostName specifications).


       <B>IdentityFile</B>
              Specifies the name  of  the  user's  identification
              file.


       <B>KeepAlive</B>
              Specifies  whether the system should send keepalive
              messages to the other  side.   If  they  are  sent,
              death  of  the  connection  or  crash of one of the
              machines will be properly noticed.   However,  this
              means  that  connections  will  die if the route is
              down temporarily, and some people find this  annoy­
              ing.

              The  default is "<B>yes</B>" (to send keepalives), and the
              client will notice if the network goes down or  the
              remote  host  dies.   This  is important when using
              scripts, and many users want it too.

              To disable keepalives, the value should be  set  to
              "<B>no</B>"  in  both the server and the client configura­
              tion files.


       <B>LocalForward</B>
              Specifies that a TCP/IP port on the  local  machine
              is  forwarded  over  the  secure  channel  to given
              host:port from the  remote  machine.  The  argument
              should be enclosed in double-quotes (""). The argu­
              ment format is <I>port:remotehost:remoteport </I>.


       <B>MACs   </B>Specifies the  MAC  (Message  Authentication  Code)
              algorithm  to  use for data integrity verification.
              Currently, <I>hmac-sha1</I>, <I>hmac-sha1-96</I>, <I>hmac-md5</I>, <I>hmac-</I>
              <I>md5-96</I>,  <I>hmac-ripemd160  </I>and  <I>hmac-ripemd160-96 </I>are
              supported, of which <I>hmac-sha1</I>, <I>hmac-sha1-96</I>,  <I>hmac-</I>
              <I>md5  </I>and  <I>hmac-md5-96 </I>are included in all distribu­
              tions. Multiple MACs can be specified as  a  comma-
              separated  list.  Special values to this option are
              <I>any</I>, <I>anystd</I>, that allows only standard (see  below)
              MACs,  and  <I>anymac </I>that allows either any available
              MAC or excludes <I>none </I>but allows all others.  <I>anyst­</I>
              <I>dmac  </I>is the same as above, but includes only those
              MACs mentioned in the  IETF-SecSH-draft  (excluding
              '<B>none</B>').


       <B>NoDelay</B>
              If  "<B>yes</B>",  enable  socket  option TCP_NODELAY. The
              argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".  Default is "<B>no</B>".


       <B>PasswordPrompt</B>
              Sets the password prompt that the  user  sees  when
              connecting  to  a host. Variables '<B>%U</B>' and '<B>%H</B>' can
              be used to give the user's  login  name  and  host,
              respectively.


       <B>Port   </B>Specifies  the port number to connect on the remote
              host.  The default port number is 22.


       <B>QuietMode</B>
              Quiet mode. Causes all warnings and diagnostic mes­
              sages  to be suppressed. Only fatal errors are dis­
              played. The argument must be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>RandomSeedFile</B>
              Specifies the name of the user's randomseed file.


       <B>RekeyIntervalSeconds</B>
              Specifies  the  number  of  seconds  that  the  key
              exchange  is  done again.  The default is 3600 sec­
              onds. A value of '0' turns rekey-requests off. This
              doesn't  prevent the server from requesting rekeys.
              Other  servers  may  not  have   rekey-capabilities
              implemented  correctly,  and your connection may be
              cut off if you're connecting to a server other than
              <B>sshd2</B>.   (The  server  may also possibly crash, but
              that is no fault of <B>ssh2</B>).


       <B>RemoteForward</B>
              Specifies that a TCP/IP port on the remote  machine
              be  forwarded  over  the  secure  channel  to given
              host:port from the  local  machine.   The  argument
              should be enclosed in double-quotes (""). The argu­
              ment format is <I>port:remotehost:remoteport </I>.


       <B>Ssh1AgentCompatibility</B>
              Specifies whether to forward  also  an  SSH1  agent
              connection.   Legal  values  for  this  option  are
              "<B>none</B>",  "<B>traditional</B>"  and  "<B>ssh2</B>".   With   value
              "<B>none</B>"  (default), the SSH1 agent connection is not
              forwarded at all.  With value  "<B>traditional</B>",  SSH1
              agent connection is forwarded transparently like in
              SSH1.  Value "<B>traditional</B>" can always be used,  but
              it  constitutes  a security risk, because the agent
              does not get the information about  the  forwarding
              path.   Value  "<B>ssh2</B>"  makes  SSH1 agent forwarding
              similar to SSH2 agent forwarding and with this mode
              agent gets the information about the agent forward­
              ing path.  Note that value "<B>ssh2</B>" can only be used,
              if  you  use ssh-agent2 in SSH1 compatibility mode.
              "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>Ssh1Compatibility</B>
              Specifies whether to use SSH1  compatibility  code.
              With  this option, <B>ssh1 </B>is executed when the server
              supports only SSH 1.x protocols. The argument  must
              be "<B>yes</B>" or "<B>no</B>".


       <B>Ssh1Path</B>
              Specifies  the  path  to <B>ssh1 </B>client, which is exe­
              cuted if the server supports only  SSH  1.x  proto­
              cols. The arguments for <B>ssh2 </B>are passed to the <B>ssh1</B>
              client.


       <B>SocksServer</B>
              Overrides the value  of  <B>SSH_SOCKS_SERVER</B>.   Other­
              wise, functions completely equivalently.


       <B>StrictHostKeyChecking</B>
              If this flag is set to "<B>yes</B>", <B>ssh2 </B>will never auto­
              matically add host keys to the <I>$HOME/.ssh2/hostkeys</I>
              directory,  and refuses to connect hosts whose host
              key has changed.  This provides maximum  protection
              against  Trojan  horse  attacks. However, it can be
              somewhat annoying if you don't have  the  necessary
              keys  in <I>/etc/ssh2/hostkeys </I>and you frequently con­
              nect new hosts. Basically this  option  forces  the
              user  to  manually add any new hosts. Normally this
              option is set to "<B>ask</B>", and new hosts will automat­
              ically  be  added to the known host files after you
              have confirmed you really want to do that. If  this
              is set to "<B>no</B>" then the new host will automatically
              be added to the known host files. The host keys  of
              known  hosts  will  be  verified  automatically  in
              either case. If this value is  set  to  "<B>ask</B>",  the
              user  also  has the option to change the key on the
              disk on the fly.

              The argument must be "<B>yes</B>", "<B>no</B>" or "<B>ask</B>".


       <B>User   </B>Specifies the user to log in as. This can be useful
              if  you  have  a  different  user name in different
              machines. This  saves  the  trouble  of  having  to
              remember  to  specify  the user name on the command
              line.


       <B>VerboseMode</B>
              Verbose mode.  Causes ssh2 to print debugging  mes­
              sages  about  its  progress.  This  is helpful when
              debugging connection, authentication, and  configu­
              ration problems.
