<!--=========================== JAVA PLATFORM =========================-->

<h2>Java 2 Platform</h2>


<ul>
<p><a name=jndi></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/jndi/index.html>Java Naming and Directory Interface<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> (JNDI)</a></b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)</b>, formerly 
    available only as a standard extension, has been added to the Java&nbsp;2 
    Platform. JNDI provides Java platform-based applications with a unified 
    interface to multiple naming and directory services in the enterprise. 
    JNDI includes support for event notification and LDAP v3 extensions and 
    controls, as well as class libraries and service providers for the 
    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP), the CORBA Object Services
    (COS) Naming Service, and the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Registry.
    </ul>
<p><a name=rmi></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/rmi/index.html>Remote Method Invocation (RMI)</a></b>
<ul>	<li><a href=../guide/rmi/relnotes.html>RMI Release Notes</a>
	<li><b><code>java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader</code></b> has a new  
		 method, <code>getClassLoader</code>.
	<li><b>Serialization enhancements</b> notable for RMI:
	<ul>	<li>Strings longer than 64K can now be serialized.
		<li>Serialization performance enhancements yeild up to 20%
			faster writes during serialization and reads during 
			deserialization. 
		<li>Improved exception reporting now reports the <i>actual</i>
			class or interface that cannot be found during
			deserialization, rather than the higher-level
			class that was being deserialized (such as the
			RMI stub class).
	</ul> 
	<li><b><a href="../tooldocs/tools-changes.html#rmic"><code>rmic</code></b></a> has several new
		options and now defaults to
		using '<code>-d .</code>' behavior if no other
		destination directory is specified using the
		<code>-d</code> option.

	<li><b><a href="../tooldocs/tools-changes.html#rmid"><code>rmid</code></b></a> now requires a security policy file.	
</ul>  


<p><a name=iiop></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/rmi-iiop/>RMI/IIOP</a></b>
<ul><li><b>RMI programmers can now use CORBA's
      IIOP communications protocol</b> to communicate with clients of any type,
      whether written entirely in the Java programming language or made up of
      components written in other CORBA-compliant languages.
      Previously Java language programmers had to choose between RMI and
      CORBA (JavaIDL) for distributed programming solutions. RMI provides an
      easy to use technology for writing distributed programs purely in the Java
      programming language. JavaIDL, while more complex than RMI, enables
      applications written in the Java programming language to communicate with
      clients and servers written in any CORBA-compatible language. 
</ul>


<p><a name=dnd></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/dragndrop/>Drag and Drop Enhancements</a></b>

<ul>
<b>Two new methods</b> in class java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor
enhance Drag and Drop operations in this release:
<tt>
<li><a href="../api/java/awt/datatransfer/DataFlavor.html#getReaderForText(java.awt.datatransfer.Transferable)">getReaderForText(Transferable) </a>
<li><a href="../api/java/awt/datatransfer/DataFlavor.html#selectBestTextFlavor(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor[])">selectBestTextFlavor(DataFlavor[])</a> 
</tt>
</ul>


<p><a name=sound></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/sound/>Java Sound</a></b>
<UL>
<li> <b>Sound engine</b>
<li> <b>Support for audio in applications</b> as well as applets.
<li> <b>New API</b> for capturing, processing, and playing back audio and 
 MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) data.
<LI> Audio file formats: <b>AIFF, AU and WAV</b></LI>
<LI> Music file formats:  <b>MIDI Type 0, MIDI Type 1, and Rich Music Format (RMF)</b></LI>
<LI> Sound formats: <b>8- and 16-bit audio data, in mono and stereo,</b>
     with sample rates from 8 kHz to 48 kHz</LI>
<LI> <b>Linear, a-law, and mu-law encoded data</b> in any of the supported audio file formats</
LI>
<LI> <b>MIDI wavetable synthesis and sequencing in software</b>, and access 
      to hardware MIDI devices</LI>
<LI><b>An all-software mixer</b> that can mix and render up to 64 total 
  channels of digital audio and synthesized MIDI music</LI>
</UL>

<p><a name=applet></a>
<li><b>Applet Deployment Enhancements</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../guide/misc/appletcaching.html">Improved Applet Caching Control</a></b> to ensure critical functions 
remain in fast-loading cache for improved performance.
<li><b>Fast Loading of Applet Support Classes</b> 
Jar files containing support classes for applets can now be placed in 
the Java 2 Runtime Environment/Plug-in <tt>lib/applet/</tt> directory. 
This reduces startup time for large applets by allowing applet classes 
to be pre-loaded from the local file system by the applet class loader, 
providing the same protections as if they had been downloaded over the 
net.
<li><b><a href="../guide/extensions/versioning.html">Automatic Installation of 
Extensions</a></b> gets the right version 
of the extension installed on the end-user machine, without requiring it 
to be downloaded repeatedly each time an applet is loaded.  Hence, faster 
start-up of applets.
<li><b><a href="../guide/jar/jar.html#JAR Index">Jar Indexing</a></b> 
allows developers to break functionality into 
different Jar files and ensure that only those that are needed for a 
given run of the applet are actually downloaded.
</ul>

<p><a name=2d></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/2d/index.html>Java 2D<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup></a></b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Multiple Monitor Support</b> is enabled by 
        the new <tt>Frame(GraphicsConfiguration)</tt> and 
	<tt>Window(Window, GraphicsConfiguration)</tt> constructors and
	<tt>getBounds</tt> method.
    <li><b>Portable Network Graphics format support</b> 
        is supported by the Java 2D API.
    <li><b>Dynamic font loading</b> is provided by new 
        API in class <tt>Font</tt>.
    <li><b>Customized stroke offsets</b> are enabled by new API in class 
        <tt>java.awt.BasicStroke</tt>.
    <li><b>New ICC Profile tags</b> have been added to bring the Java 2D
	API into compliance with the latest ICC specification.
    <li><b>Improved paragraph balancing and hyphenation</b> is enabled 
	by the <tt>TextMeasurer</tt> class.
    <li><b>Access to a ColorModel's transfer type</b> is possible
	through the new <tt>getTransferType</tt> method.
    <li><b>Validity checking of Palette Entries</b> is enabled by a new 
	<tt>IndexColorModel</tt> constructor and the
	new <tt>isValid(int)</tt> and <tt>getValidPixels</tt> methods.
    </ul>

<p><a name=swing></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/swing/>Swing Enhancements</a></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Many enhancements have been made to Swing</b>, including additions 
to the API and performance enhancements to the SDK's implementation. See 
<b><a href="../guide/swing/SwingChanges.html">Swing Changes and New Features</a></b> 
for descriptions of enhancements added to Swing in this release.
</ul>

<p><a name=awt></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/awt/>AWT Enhancements</a></b>
<ul>
   <li>See <b><a href=../guide/awt/enhancements.html>AWT Enhancements</a></b> 
for more details on the changes summarized here.
    <li><b>Multiple Monitor Support</b> is enabled by 
        the new <tt>Frame(GraphicsConfiguration)</tt> and 
	<tt>Window(Window, GraphicsConfiguration)</tt> constructors and
	<tt>getBounds</tt> method.
   <li><b>New class <a href=../api/java/awt/Robot.html><tt>java.awt.Robot</tt></a></b> has been added to the 
Java 2 Platform.  <tt>Robot</tt> is designed to make it possible 
to automate testing of AWT components.
   <li><b>New event masks for PaintEvents and Invocation events</b> have 
been added to class <tt>AWTEvent</tt>.
   <li><b>Paint coalescing</b> has been implemented which will 
enhancement painting performance.
   <li><b>The printing API has been enhanced</b> by the addition of 
two new classes: <tt><a href=../api/java/awt/JobAttributes.html>java.awt.JobAttributes</a></tt> and <tt><a href=../api/java/awt/PageAttributes.html>java.awt.PageAttributes</a></tt>. These classes 
control attributes of print jobs and printed pages, respectively, 
and are used by new form of method <tt><a href="../api/java/awt/Toolkit.html#getPrintJob(java.awt.Frame, java.lang.String, java.awt.JobAttributes, java.awt.PageAttributes)">Toolkit.getPrintJob</a></tt>.
   <li><b>A new event type for tracking changes to component 
hierarchies</b> has been introduced.  The new event type notifies 
listeners of various changes in a component's hierarchy, such 
as ancestor moves, ancestor deletions, and more.
   <li><b>New C headers</b> have been added to the SDK as a convenient, 
standard way to allow native code to access AWT components. 
</ul>

<p><a name=security></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/security/>Security</a></b>
<ul>
<li>See <b><a href=../guide/security/enhancements.html>Security 
Enhancements</a></b> for a fuller list of changes in this release.
<li>
<b>trustProxy</b> property is now true by default</b>. See the 
<a href=../guide/security/enhancements.html#trustProxy>Security 
Enhancements</a> document for more details.
<li>
<b>A new signature verification method</b>, <tt><a href=../api/java/security/Signature.html#initVerify(java.security.cert.Certificate)>initVerify(Certificate)</a></tt> has been added to <tt>java.security.Signature</tt>, and this new method is FIPS 140-1 compliant. FIPS
              140-1 requires a public key to be passed as a certificate, which is accomplished through the addition of
              <tt>initVerify(Certificate)</tt>. 
<li><b>New <a href=../api/java/security/DomainCombiner.html><code>DomainCombiner</code></a> interface</b> provides a means to dynamically
update the ProtectionDomains associated with the current <code>AccessControlContext</code>.

<li><b>New class <a href=../api/java/security/spec/RSAKeyGenParameterSpec.html><tt>java.security.spec.RSAKeyGenParameterSpec</tt></a></b> makes it possible to specify both the size of the (to-be-generated) public
              modulus and the value of the public exponent when generating an RSA keypair. 
<li><b>Two new methods</b> have been added to <tt>java.security.Security</tt>, making it possible to select service providers based on the capabilities that they offer:
   <ul><tt>
   <li><a href=../api/java/security/Security.html#getProviders(java.util.Map)>getProviders(Map)</a>
   <li><a href=../api/java/security/Security.html#getProviders(java.lang.String)>getProviders(String)</a>
   </tt></ul>
<li><b>Method <a href=../api/java/security/KeyPairGenerator.html#generateKeyPair()><tt>java.security.KeyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair()</tt></a> has been restored</b> to ensure backwards compatibility with JDK 1.1.x. 

<li>
<b>The new -provider command line option</b> has been added to 
<a href=../tooldocs/win32/keytool.html>keytool</a> and 
<a href=../tooldocs/win32/jarsigner.html>jarsigner</a> which
        allows the user to specify a particular service provider not listed in
        the security properties file.
<li><b><a href=../tooldocs/win32/jarsigner.html>Jarsigner</a> can now verify</b> Netscape-signed jar files.
<li><b>The handling of X.509 certificates</b> has been updated to include
        support for multiple Attribute/Value Assertions (AVA's) within a
        Relative Distinguished Name (RDN).
<li><b>The <a href=../api/java/security/interfaces/RSAKey.html>RSAKey</a> interface</b> has been added to allow a generic examination of
        keys before examining them in detail.
<li><b>Enhancements</b> have been made to support all X.520 attributes that are either mandated or recommended by PKIX RFC 2459.
</ul>


<p><a name=net></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/net/>Networking</a></b>
<br>The following enhancements have been made to networking.  See also 
<a href=../guide/net/enhancements.html>Networking Enhancements</a> for 
more details.
<ul>
<li><b>TCP half-close sockets are now supported</b> with the additions of methods <tt>shutdownInput()</tt> and <tt>shutdownOutput()</tt> to classes <tt>java.net.Socket</tt> and <tt>java.net.SocketImpl</tt> 
<li><b>Java sockets now support the keepalive option</b> with the addition of methods <tt>setKeepAlive(boolean on)</tt> and <tt>boolean getKeepAlive()</tt> in <tt>java.net.Socket</tt>. 
<li><b>New interface <tt>java.net.DatagramSocketImplFactory</tt></b>, which is used by <tt>DatagramSocket</tt> to create actual socket implementations. This addition makes <tt>DatagramSocket</tt> consistent with the other socket types, by allowing the user to set the <tt>DatagramSocketImplFactory</tt> through a public API. 
<li><b>Improved system flexibility</b> through changes in <tt>java.net.URL, java.net.URLConnection</tt>, and <tt>java.net.ContentHandler</tt>. The URL parsing
        now better matches the rules specified in RFC 2396.  Some new
        methods have been added to obtain the components of a parsed URL.
 <li><b>Added HTTP 1.1</b> client-side support.
</ul>
<p><a name=reflection></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/reflection/>Reflection Enhancements</a></b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>A new API for <a href=../guide/reflection/proxy.html>dynamic 
    proxy classes</a></b> has been added to the Java 2 Platform. A 
    dynamic proxy class is a class that implements
    a list of interfaces specified at runtime such that a method
    invocation through one of the interfaces on an instance of the class
    will be encoded and dispatched to another object through a uniform
    interface.  Thus, a dynamic proxy class can be used to create a
    type-safe proxy object for a list of interfaces without requiring
    pre-generation of the proxy class, such as with compile time tools.
    Dynamic proxy classes are useful to applications that need to
    provide type-safe reflective dispatch of invocations to objects that
    present interface APIs.   For example, an application can use a 
    dynamic proxy class to create an object that implements multiple 
    arbitrary event listener interfaces -- interfaces that extend 
    <code>java.util.EventListener</code> -- to process a variety of 
    events of different types in a uniform fashion, such as by logging 
    all such events to a file.
    </ul>

<p><a name=serialization></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/serialization>Object Serialization</a></b>
<br>Many enhancements to serialization's functionality and performance have 
been made in version 1.3 of the Java 2 Platform. See <a href=../guide/serialization/relnotes.html>Object Serialization Enhancements</a> for details.
<ul>
	<li><b>Strings longer than 64K can now be serialized.</b>
     <li><b>Serialization performance enhancements</b> yeild up to 20%
			faster writes during serialization and reads during 
			deserialization. 
	<li><b>Improved exception reporting</b> now reports the <i>actual</i>
			class or interface that cannot be found during
			deserialization, rather than the higher-level
			class that was being deserialized (such as the
			RMI stub class).
<li><b>New methods</b> for enhanced functionality.
<ul>
<li><a href="../api/java/io/ObjectOutputStream.html#writeClassDescriptor(java.io.ObjectStreamClass)">java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeClassDescriptor</a>
<li><a href="../api/java/io/ObjectOutputStream.html#annotateProxyClass(java.lang.Class)">java.io.ObjectOutputStream.annotateProxyClass</a>
<li><a href="../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#readClassDescriptor()">java.io.ObjectInputStream.readClassDescriptor</a>
<li><a href="../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#resolveProxyClass(java.lang.String[])">java.io.ObjectInputStream.resolveProxyClass</a>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><a name=access></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/access/>Accessibility</a></b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Several new classes and interfaces have been added</b> to 
        the accessibility API of the Java 2 Platform.
        <ul>
        <li><b><a href=../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleIcon.html>
        AccessibleIcon</a></b> provides information about icons and 
        is implemented by Swing icons.
        <li><b><a href=../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleRelation.html>
        AccessibleRelation</a></b> and <b><a href=../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleRelationSet.html>AccessibleRelationSet</a></b> provide information 
        about the ways user interface objects are related to each other. 
        <li><a href="../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleTable.html"><b>AccessibleTable</b></a> provides information about tables, and is implemented by
Swing's <a href="../api/javax/swing/JTable.AccessibleJTable.html"><b>JTable.AccessibleJTable</b></a> class.
        <li><a href="../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleTableModelChange.html"><b>AccessibleTableModelChange</b></a> is a helper class which
encapsulates a change to the model of a table.
        </ul>
    <li><b>Accessibility support has been included in both AWT Component and 
        AWT Container</b>, making creation of accessible custom components 
        easier. This also means that 
        accessibility support is not only present in Swing components, 
        it is also part of all lightweight AWT components.
    <li><b>Class java.applet.Applet now implements the Accessible interface</b>.
    <li><b>The AWT's new <a href=../api/java/awt/Robot.html>Robot</a> class</b> 
    provides a way to insert keystrokes and mouse events at the system
    level. This feature enhances accessibility because it allows the physical
    on-screen mouse cursor to be moved. This enables screen magnification
    software for native environments to recognize and respond to mouse 
    movements that could not previously be identified by assistive 
    technologies outside of the virtual machine.
    </ul>

<p><a name=im></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/imf/>Input Method Framework</a></b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>An Input Method Engine Service Provider Interface</b> has been 
    added to the platform. 
    The new SPI enables the development of input method engines in the 
    Java programming language that can be used with any Java runtime 
    environment.
    <li><b>Below-the-spot text input</b> has been implemented. 
    Below-the-spot text input, popular in Chinese-speaking countries, 
    uses a separate composition window that is positioned automatically to be 
    near the point where the text is to be inserted after being committed.
    </ul>

<p><a name=collections></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/collections>Collections Framework Enhancements</a></b>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Added <a href="../api/java/util/Collections.html#singletonList(java.lang.Object)">singletonList</a> and <a href="../api/java/util/Collections.html#singletonMap(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">singletonMap</a>.</strong>
Previously, there was a convenience implementation for singleton Set, but no
corresponding implementation for List and Map.  Both of these
implementations proved desirable in practice.
<li><strong>Added <a href="../api/java/util/Collections.html#EMPTY_MAP">EMPTY_MAP</a>.</strong>
Previously, there were constant convenience implementations for the empty Set
and List, but no corresponding implementation for Map.
<li>
<strong>Added <a href="../api/java/util/WeakHashMap.html#WeakHashMap(java.util.Map)">Map
constructor</a> for WeakHashMap</strong>.  The 
<a href="../api/java/util/Map.html">Map</a> interface dictates that most
Map implementations should have a "copy constructor" that takes a Map
argument.  WeakHashMap lacked such a constructor in the 1.2 release.
</ul>


<p><a name=math></a>
<li><b><a href=../guide/math>Enhancements to <tt>java.math</tt></a></b>
   <ul>
   <li><b>The <tt><a href="../api/java/math/BigDecimal.html#BigDecimal(java.lang.String)">BigDecimal(String)</a></tt> constructor has been enhanced</b> to allow 
signed strings (for example, <tt>"+2.71828"</tt>) and exponential notation 
(for example, <tt>"1.23E-23"</tt>) as input.
   <li><b>Class <tt><a href=../api/java/math/BigInteger.html>java.math.BigInteger</a></tt> has been reimplemented</b> in pure 
Java programming-language code.  Previously, <tt>BigInteger</tt>'s 
implementation was based on an underlying C library.  The new 
implementation performs all standard operations much faster 
than the old implementation. The speed-up realized in the new 
implementation can be as much as 5x or more, depending on the 
operation being performed and the length of the operands.

   </ul>

<p><a name=lang></a>
<li><a href=../guide/lang><b>Enhancements in java.lang and java.util.*</b></a>
   <ul>
   <li><b>Package <tt>java.lang</tt> now has both a <tt><a href=../api/java/lang/Math.html>Math</a></tt> class and a <tt><a href=../api/java/lang/StrictMath.html>StrictMath</a></tt> class.</b>  New class <tt>StrictMath</tt> has the 
same API as class <tt>Math</tt>, but 
is defined to return bit-for-bit reproducible results for numeric 
operations in all implementations. This is in contrast to class <tt>Math</tt> 
which is not defined to return bit-for-bit 
same results across implementations.  Implementations of class <tt>Math</tt> 
can vary within specified constraints to allow flexibility for better 
performance.
   <li><b>A new Timer API</b> has been added to the Java 2 Platform to 
support animations, human interaction timeouts, on-screen clocks and calendars,
work-scheduling routines, reminder facilities, and more.
<ul>
   <li><tt><a href=../api/java/util/Timer.html>java.util.Timer</a></tt>
   <li><tt><a href=../api/java/util/TimerTask.html>java.util.TimerTask</a></tt>
</ul>
<tt><a href=../guide/lang/Countdown.java>Countdown.java</a></tt> is a simple demo application that uses the new Timer API.
   <li><b>An API for virtual machine shutdown hooks</b> has been added 
to class <tt>java.lang.Runtime</tt> that provides a simple, portable 
interface to the underlying operating system's process-shutdown notification 
so that an application written in the Java programming language can 
initiate shutdown actions such as closing  
down network connections, saving session state, and deleting temporary files.
   <li><b>New "delete-on-close" mode for opening Zip and Jar files</b> 
has been added so that long-running server applications can delete 
no-longer-needed JarFile objects and data to keep disk space free.
</ul>

<p><a name=ext></a>
<li><a href=../guide/extensions><b>Enhancements to the Extension Mechanism</b></a> and <b><a href=../guide/jar>Jar Files</a></b>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../guide/extensions/versioning.html">Automatic Installation of 
Extensions</a></b> gets the right version 
of the extension installed on the end-user machine, without requiring it 
to be downloaded repeatedly each time an applet is loaded.  Hence, faster 
start-up of applets.
<li><b><a href="../guide/jar/jar.html#JAR Index">Jar Indexing</a></b> 
allows developers to break functionality into 
different Jar files and ensure that only those that are needed for a

<li><b>Support for Motif 2.1</b>
<ul>
J2SE 1.3 uses Motif 2.1 (on the Solaris 7 and Solaris 8 operating 
environments), as distinguished from Motif 1.2 (which is still used 
on the Solaris 2.6 operating environment). Since 2.1 is the supported 
version of Motif going forward, switching to 2.1 allows the Java 2 
platform to take advantage of future features and bug fixes in Motif.
<p>
Motif 2.1 is compatible in both functionality and performance to 
Motif 1.2, except that it adds two features that might be of use 
for the Java 2 platform:
<ul>
<li>Motif 2.1 is multi-thread safe. Applications implemented partly 
in native code that use Motif 
directly through the <tt>jawt</tt> interface or the 
<tt>DrawingSurface</tt> interface can benefit from this feature. (Pure 
Java applications are already MT-safe.)
<li>Motif 2.1 includes new Complex Text Layout (CTL) software for 
advanced locale support.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<ul>
<li><b><a href=../guide/performance>Performance</a></b> 
<ul><li>Many enhancements have been made to improve the performance of 
the Java 2 SDK and Java 2 Runtime Environment.  These changes 
include the <b>addition of the Java HotSpot<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 
Client Virtual Machine</b>. 
The Solaris and Linux versions of the Java 2 SDK and Java 2 Runtime 
Environment also contain the Java HotSpot Server VM. Both the 
Client and Server VMs contain state-of-the-art Java HotSpot technology. 
The Client VM is tuned to maximize performance on client systems, 
improving performance in areas of startup time and memory footprint. 
The Server VM is tuned to maximize performance of program execution 
speed and is aimed at server applications that are less concerned 
with startup and memory footprint.
<p>
The Java HotSpot Server VM is available for Win32 platforms as a 
separate download.  See the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot/2.0/download.html">Java 
HotSpot</a> web site to obtain the Win32 Java HotSpot Server VM v2.0.

<p><li><b><a href=../guide/jpda/>Java Platform Debugger Architecture</a></b>
<ul><li>The Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) consists of 
three interfaces designed for use by debuggers in development environments 
for desktop systems. The <b>Java Virtual Machine Debug Interface</b> defines 
the services a VM must provide for debugging.  The <b>Java Debug Wire 
Protocol</b> defines the format of information and requests transferred 
between the process being debugged and the debugger front end, which 
implements the Java Debug Interface.  The <b>Java Debug Interface</b> defines 
information and requests at the user code level.</ul>

See <b><a href="../tooldocs/tools-changes.html">Tool Changes</a></b> for 
details on the changes summarized here.

<ul>
<p><li> The <b>javac</b> compiler has been completely re-implemented in 
version 1.3 of the Java 2 SDK for faster operation.  

<p><li>The <b>jarsigner</b> and <b>keytool</b> utilities have a new 
<tt>-provider</tt> option that can be used to specify the name of cryptographic service provider's master 
class file when the service provider is not listed in the security 
properties file. 

<p><li>The <b>Jar</b> tool now provides for the 
<a href="../guide/jar/jar.html#JAR Index">indexing of Jar 
files</a> so that Jar-file contents can be accessed quickly and 
easily. 

<a name="rmic">
<p><li>The functionality of the <b>rmic</b> tool (the Java RMI stub compiler) 
has been enhanced with several new options.


<p><li>Version 1.3 of the Java 2 SDK uses the new high-performance virtual 
machine with Java HotSpot<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> technology.

<p><li>The version-related options of the <b>Java</b> application 
launcher have been modified to present information in terms of 
the values of system properties. . 

<p><li>The <b>javaw</b> launcher has been 
modified so that it will now display a window with error messages 
in the event that an application fails to launch.
