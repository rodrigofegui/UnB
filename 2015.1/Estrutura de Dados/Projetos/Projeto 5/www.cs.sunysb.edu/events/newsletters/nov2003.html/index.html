<Center><STRONG>SYSTEMS STAFF MONTHLY UPDATE - NOVEMBER 2003</STRONG></center>

<P><STRONG>WREQ Problem Reporting Tool</STRONG><BR>
Email work requests and problem reports are now being entered into
the WREQ problem reporting tool.  You should submit all requests
directly to WREQ and not to ntadmin or individual staff members. You
can do this by posting a request through the web interface at:
<A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~wreq">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~wreq</A> or simply by sending your email request
to WREQ at cs dot sunysb dot edu.

<P>There is now a WREQ Problem Reporting Tool for work requests directed 
to the department secretarial and administrative staff.  You should 
use secwreq for requests such as requisitions, course room changes, 
office supplies, grade changes, room reservations, payroll issues, 
tuition issues, reimbursements and building management needs.  This 
tool can be found at <A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~secwreq">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~secwreq</A> or you can send 
mail to SECWREQ at cs dot sunysb dot edu.

<P>Please note that there is a 10K upper limit on the size of a message
submitted to WREQ.  If you need to include more information than
that you can include a pointer to a file, or mail the information
separately to root.  Also, WREQ accepts mail only from department
email addresses at this time, and does not accept MIME attachments.
There is an FAQ on the use of WREQ at: 
<A HREF="http://www/FAQ/MiscReportProblems.html">http://www/FAQ/MiscReportProblems.html</A>.

<P><STRONG>Announcement</STRONG>

<P>The labs located in rooms 2114 and 2129 will be closed for exams this 
Friday, December 5, from 12:30PM to 6:00PM.

<P><STRONG>New/Upgraded Software for Solaris</STRONG>

<P>The following perl modules have been installed:
<PRE>
        Mail-MboxParser-0.43
        Mail-Mbox-MessageParser-1.11
        IO-String-1.03
        MIME-tools-5.411
        IO-stringy-2.108
        Mail-Mbox-MessageParser-1.12
        Storable-2.08
        FileHandle-Unget-0.11
        MIME-Base64-2.21
        FreezeThaw-0.43
        XML-Simple-2.09
        XML-SAX-0.12
        XML-NamespaceSupport-1.08

</PRE>
<P><STRONG>New/Upgraded Software for SGI</STRONG>

<P>        Matlab has been upgraded to version 13 on sbcube6.

<P><STRONG>Infrastructure Changes and Upgrades</STRONG>

<P>Printer accounting has been turned on in an effort to help 
conserve resources.  Please keep in mind that printer supplies 
such as paper and toner are costly, and that every dollar wasted 
is a dollar that could have been spent on equipment or salaries.
You can view print statistics on any department machine in
/var/adm/sysinfo/info/accounting.  The file printing.ytd is a
running total for all users, facprinting.XXX and otherprinting.XXX
show faculty and student/guest usage on a monthly basis.

<P><STRONG>Antispam Facility</STRONG>

<P>At the direction of the Operations Committee the department
spam filtering system has been enabled.

<P>Department users have the choice of participating in the spam
filtering system. If you choose to be OUT of the system ALL of
your mail will be delivered without spam screening.

<P>If you choose to be IN the system your mail will be filtered
for spam content. Non-spam mail will be delivered as usual.

<P>Mail flagged as likely spam will be set aside in a holding area
by the anti-spam system. Two times per day you will be emailed
a spam digest. The spam digest will list your spam mails which
have accumulated since the last digest was emailed to you.
If you receive no spam then you will not receive a digest.

<P>By default all faculty are opted out of the spam filtering system,
and all students are opted into the spam filtering system.
Anyone can change their option in the spam filtering system by
visiting <A HREF="http://intrawww/~sso">http://intrawww/~sso</A>. Your login and password are the
same as you use to log into the unix systems.

<P>Please see the FAQ at <BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/DepartmentSpamFilter.html">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/DepartmentSpamFilter.html</A> for answers to 
questions you might have about this facility.

<P>Also note that information is available for customizing filters
in all common mail readers at <BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/EmailFilterJunk.html">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/EmailFilterJunk.html</A>.

<P>If you are participating in the spam filtering system and you
receive mail which is spam and was not tagged by the system, please
forward that mail to "SPAM at cs dot sunysb dot edu".  If legitimate mail was
flagged by the system and had to be manually retrieved by you,
please forward that mail to "NOTSPAM at cs dot sunysb dot edu".  Important
note: forward only the message itself, do not forward the digest in 
the case of legitimate mail.  Use a simple "forward" command to send 
the message, do not send it as an attachment of any kind.  Include
the full set of headers if your mailer allows it.  Do not include 
comments or questions as this mail is machine processed and will not 
be read by an administrator.  The learning feature happens over time 
and you will not see any change immediately reflected.  Continue to 
forward spam as it is received and eventually it should be detected 
by the system.

<P><STRONG>New labs</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>New Network Facilities</STRONG>

<P>Wireless access is now available in room 2129, the Programming
Techniques teaching lab. A wired network jack for use by the
instructor is available at the podium at the lower right 
side of the podium (as you face the audience).

<P>The wired network is now enabled in room 2311 (wireless was
previously enabled).<BR>
The wired network covers the rear two rows of tables in room
2311. The electric outlets at each table are live also.

<P><STRONG>Upgrades</STRONG>

<P>The instructor's podium in room 2129 now has video, network,
and power available for a laptop connection. Two live outlets,
a 10baseT tap and a video conection to the projector are located
at the lower right side of the podium (as you face the audience).

<P><STRONG>PCs and Laptops</STRONG>

<P>The backup system for faculty PCs and research laptops is in
operation.  In order to be included in the backup system your
PC or laptop must be a part of the secured backup domain.  You
will be receiving an email with instructions on how to schedule
an appointment to have the necessary configuration changes made
to your PC or research laptop.

<P>A CERT advisory regarding a buffer overflow attack on Windows
Workstation Service was released in November.  Please make certain
that your PC or laptop is up-to-date with all Microsoft critical
updates and patches.  There is an FAQ on this topic at:
<A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/MiscWindowsUpdate.html">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/MiscWindowsUpdate.html</A>.

<P><STRONG>New Facilities</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Future plans</STRONG>

<P>Network switches will be upgraded to gigabit capability
and the first CAT 6 network cables will be installed this
month.

<P><STRONG>The Stony Brook Community</STRONG>

<P>The campus has reported problems with remote access to Notes during
the month of November.  There is a web page on the campus web server
offering workarounds for Notes users at 
<A HREF="http://clientsupport.stonybrook.edu/notes/POP.shtml">http://clientsupport.stonybrook.edu/notes/POP.shtml</A>.

<P><STRONG>HOW TO REPORT A PROBLEM or MAKE A WORK REQUEST</STRONG>

<P>First you should check the FAQ pages at:

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/index.html">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FA
Q/index.html</A>

<P>There is also a link to an index of FAQs.

<P>If the answer to your question is not in the faq's you should use wreq
to report the problem or make a work request.

<P>There is a short blurb on wreq in the faq area (search by index).

<P>Wreq lives at: <A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~wreq/">http://www.cs.sunysb
.edu/~wreq/</A>

<P>You can also send email to:WREQ at cs dot sunysb dot edu 
from your dept account, 
or campus account. The subject line should cover what is wrong or what 
you need. The body of the email can supply any details.

<P>Your problem report must include the following information for us to be
able to help you promptly:

<OL>
  <LI>The room you are working in, either room number or lab name.
  <LI>The name of the host you are working on (hostname command in Unix, 
        machine number in 1239, the number written on the bookshelf by
        your desk in the student offices).
  <LI>The sequence of things you did just prior to having the problem
        as best you recollect.
  <LI>The exact text of any error message you see on the screen, or
        a complete description of the problem that occured.

</OL>
<PRE>
        Please report problems promptly as they occur so they can be
        investigated under the same set of conditions as far as possible.

</PRE>
