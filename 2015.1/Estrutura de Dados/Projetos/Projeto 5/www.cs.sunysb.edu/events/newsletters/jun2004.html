            </ol>            
            <p align="justify">1. What is SSO ?<br>
  SSO stands for Single Sign On. What SSO provides is 
  One Sign-On and access to manyapplications. All the<br>
  applications available through SSO require user verification 
  and have access restrictions (e.g. You must be a faculty member, <br>
  students have read-only access, Good Standing Letters are 
  restricted to department graduate students). Your credentials are <br>
  entered once per session and used for all the applications 
  available on SSO during the session.</p>
            <p align="justify">2. Why do we have SSO ?<br>
  SSO resulted from a desire to provide web access to department 
  applications, services and data with the need to control access 
  to these applications or data. For example, we do not intend to  
  provide MSDNAA access to the entire campus or Internet community 
  but we'd like to provide access to our user community at home
  or in their dorms. This requires some form of access control 
  and authentication. We also desired one-stop-shopping. One place to 
  access certain services or data.</p>
            <p align="justify">3. Why is SSO accessed using https ?<br>
  Because you will type your login name and password into the login 
  screen of SSO to start your session. Department policy and 
  common sense prohibit transmission of login information in clear- 
  text. Some of the data provided to or from SSO is sensitive and we 
  prefer to see it encrypted before it wizzes over the Internet. 
  Rather than bounce from encryption to non-encryption (and being 
  vulnerable to accidental clear-text transmission) we prefer to 
  CYOA and encrypt everything.</p>
            <p>4. What services are available through this SSO ?<br>
  MSDNAA, AntiSpam Options, ReserveRoom, Good Standing Letter Form, 
  Faculty data, downloads.</p>
            <p align="justify">5. What is MSDNAA ?<br>
  Microsoft Developer Network Academic Alliance. The goal is to 
  put their latest tools, software and technical information<br>
  into the hands of CS and IS faculty and students. MSDNAA requires 
  tracking who has access to software.</p>
            <p align="justify">6. What is AntiSpam Options ?<br>
  AntiSpam Options allows a department user to opt to utilize the CS 
  department email AntiSpam System (spam filtering, and journal of

            <p align="justify">7. What is ReserveRoom ?<br>
  Reserveroom is a room reservation program. Essentially a calendar 
  system to mark, and track the usage of conference and classrooms. 
  Creation of reservations is currently restricted to faculty.</p>
            <p align="justify">8. What is Faculty Only Area ?<br>
  As the name implies the content is meant for department faculty 
  only.</p>
            <p align="justify">9. What is the Good Standing Letter Form ?<br>
  Students in the U.S. on a visa require a Letter of Good Standing 
  if they plan to visit home and return to the U.S. to continue their 
  studies. This is a form which collects the essential information 
  required to create the letter and emails the result to the graduate 
  secretary who creates the letter for you. This is restricted to 
  department graduate students. Domestic students do not need a 
  letter of good standing to visit home.</p>
            <p align="justify">10. What is the Downloads item for ?<br>
  The Downloads contains software which has been acquired for the use 
  of computer science faculty, staff and students. Some software is 
  also available to all Stony Brook students via university channels.</p>
            <p align="justify">11. What user name and password do I login with ?<br>
  Use your department login and password (also referred to as 
  compserv login or Unix login) not your editwww login information.</p>
            <p align="justify">12. How do I end my session ?<br>
              Select the logout item from the main menu, close your browser or 
              current window. This prevents other users from using your <br>
              credentials to access SSO.</p>
      <p align="justify">13. How do I report problems and make suggestions for new applications ?<br>
  Use <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/%7Ewreq">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~wreq</a> on the department web site or email WREQ AT cs dot sunysb dot edu </p>
            <p align="justify">14. How do I use the MSDNAA application ?<br>
  Log into SSO, select MSDNAA. You will see a list of software 
  available to you. Items highlighted in red require an activation  
  key to use the software. Software titles in black font can be 
  installed directly from the CD. Other colored fonts may be 
  displayed depending if the software is restricted your group 
  (faculty/grads/staff). Click on your software selection and 
  then click on submit. The loan agreement will be displayed next. 
  Next you will get a page (that needs to be printed and filled out). 
  It is the physical receipt which the CS library retains when you 
  go to check out your CD. Any license keys are emailed to your account.</p>
            <p align="justify">15. How do I use the AntiSpam Options application ?<br>
  Log into SSO, select AntiSpam Options. You have 3 bulleted choices: 
  Opt into Spam filtering, Opt Out of Spam filtering, and get a 
  current digest (on demand copy) of all frozen Spams for you. You 
  can only make one choice at a time. Select submit and exit to 
  submit your choice or the &quot;Back&quot; button of your browser to leave 
  the application without taking any action.</p>
            <p align="justify">16. How do I use the Reserveroom application ?<br>
  First the bad news: only faculty and administrative support persons 
  can make reservations. Students may view reservations. Log into SSO 
  and select ReserveRoom. A pop-up of all rooms and associated 
  capacities will appear. You should read it at least once. Next a 
  calendar like webpage will appear with room names and numbers on 
  the left side of the page. There will be a list of rooms for each 
  day of the current week. Across the top of each day's list of rooms 
  are time slots in 15 minute chunks. At the top and bottom of the 
  page are some buttons and boxes. You can advance a week or revert 
  a week by clicking the appropriate button. You can fill in the 
  week to go directly to that weeks reservations. A button is 
  available to take you back to the SSO menu, to pop-up the room 
  list and to pop-up the department room reservation priority 
  guidelines. Room reservations are blocked in red and the letters 
  RSV are placed in the start time of the reservation block. The 
  shortcut method to find who has reserved the room is to hover your 
  mouse over the RSV for the room and time slot you are interested 
  in. The name will appear (similar to a tag). If you click on the 
  RSV you will get a pop-up which will show more details about the 
  reservation (reason, resources needed). If you are the owner of 
  the reservation this pop-up will allow you to modify or delete 
  the reservation. To make a new reservation go to the start date 
  desired and click on the room number or name. A pop-up will 
  appear which you need to fill out with at least your login-name, 
  the start and finish times for the reservation. If this is a 
  repeating (weekly, bi-weekly etc) then use the pull down list 
  to select the repeating sequence that fits your needs. Select 
  Reserve or Cancel to back-out. If you select Reserve and there's 
  no conflicts then you'll get an Ok pop-up listing the dates 
  reserved. If there are conflicts those dates will noted and not 
  reserved.</p>
            <p align="justify">17. How do I use the Faculty Only area ?<br>
  If you're not faculty, you don't. If you are faculty then log 
  into SSO and select Faculty Only. If you need items added to <br>
  the Faculty Only area email wreq or use WREQ on www to have 
  it done please. </p>
            <p align="justify">18. How do I use the Good Standing Letter Form ?<br>
  If you are not a CD department graduate student you can stop here. 
  You can't use the form. Grad students log into SSO and select 
  Good Standing Letter Form. You fill in the blanks and after you 
  submit the form it will be emailed to the proper graduate 
  secretary who will put it into an INS pleasing form for you. 
  If you enter rubbish you'll annoy the secretary and INS.</p>
            <p align="justify">19. How do I use the Downloads application ?<br>
  Log into SSO and select the Downloads application. The downloads 
  page is grouped by purpose of the software (e.g. anti-spyware, X11, 
  SSH, Anti-virus). There are three columns: the link to the actual 
  software, the package's website, and comments regarding the 
  software. When you select a package the download process will begin.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>PCs and Laptops</strong><br>
              Recently it was discovered that one of the research labs in the department 
              had several PCs harboring a trojan horse program and also several PCs 
              missing critical security patches. There is an FAQ on how to make
              certain you have all critical patches for your PC at: 
              http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/MiscWindowsUpdate.html. There is another 
              FAQ on protecting your PC from viruses and sypware at: 
              http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/VirusesAndSpyware.html. We recommend 
              that private labs set up a centralized server to distribute patches, 
              manage security policies, and distribute and manage anti-virus 
              software. Please send mail to wreq if you would like assistance from
              the staff to set up such a server.<br>
