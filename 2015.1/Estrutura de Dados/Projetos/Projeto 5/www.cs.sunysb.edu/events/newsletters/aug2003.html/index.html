<STRONG>SYSTEMS STAFF MONTHLY UPDATE - August 2003</STRONG>
</center>

<P><STRONG>Announcements</STRONG>

<P>We would like to welcome all the new students to the department
and also welcome back returning students.  We hope you had a
pleasant summer and wish you a productive and successful academic
year.  If you have questions or problems relating to the department's
computer systems please see the information below on how to report
them to the staff.  You can view pictures from Orientation Day on
the department's web site at <BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/news/stories/Orientation2003/">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/news/stories/Orientation2003/</A>.

<P>We would also like to welcome to the department visiting professor
Tzi-Dar Chiueh.  Professor Chiueh is a professor from Electrical 
Engineering Department of National Taiwan University. He received his 
Ph.D. from Caltech and his current research area is wireless communications, 
in particular, physical-layer protocols and hardware implementations.
He will be visiting the department for the coming year, working mainly
on a wireless switched network project and a high-performance system
interconnect project. He is also interested in collaborating with others
in sensor networking and digital TV areas.

<P><STRONG>WREQ Problem Reporting Tool</STRONG>

<P>Email work requests and problem reports are now being entered into
the WREQ problem reporting tool.  You should submit all requests
directly to WREQ and not to ntadmin or individual staff members. You
can do this by posting a request through the web interface at:
<A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~wreq">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~wreq</A> or simply by sending your email request
to WREQ at cs dot sunysb dot edu.

<P>When you use WREQ for your request it goes to the entire
staff simultaneously, so that the person best able to help you
sees it immediately.  It is logged in a central location so that it
cannot accidently be overlooked in someone's mailbox.  You will
automatically receive updates by email when the problem is either
resolved or updated along the path to resolution.  Finally, you can
look it up online yourself at any point to see its status and any
notes a staff person may have made.

<P><STRONG>Department MS Windows Systems</STRONG>

<P>Student accounts will be active in the Transaction Processing Lab
starting Wednesday Sept. 3.  These accounts are created from the
class rosters.  Students should refer to
<A HREF="http://www.translab.cs.sunysb.edu/studentAcct.html">http://www.translab.cs.sunysb.edu/studentAcct.html</A>
for information regarding their accounts.

<P>Six additional systems have been added to the Programming Techniques 
Teaching Lab (Roomt 2129) making a total of 47 student seats.

<P>The computers in the TA Helpdesk room (Room 2110) have all been
upgraded.

<P><STRONG>Linux</STRONG>

<P>VMWare accounts are available for students who would like to try out
the Linux interface and user software.  Email VMWARE at cs dot sunysb dot edu
if you would like to set up an account.

<P>There are also virtual machine accounts available for students
who would like to try kernel development under Linux.  Email 
VMWARE at cs dot sunysb dot edu if you would like to set up one of these
accounts.

<P><STRONG>Web</STRONG>

<P>The new website was deployed on August 25.  We value your input, 
so please send comments and suggestions to WEBADM at cs dot sunysb dot edu.

<P>Some new FAQs have been added to the department website, including
how to set up mail filters in CDE and why you may receive a bounce
warning for email you never sent.  The FAQ area has answers to many
other common questions.  We are always willing to consider your
suggestions for other FAQs you think would be helpful, send them to 
WEBADM at cs dot sunysb dot edu.

<P>The renumbering of graduate courses on the department website has
been completed.  Please email root if you need the password to your 
course web account.

<P><STRONG>Labs</STRONG>

<P>On August 4 the Visualization Lab had a visit from Tohei Nitta, Ph.D.,
Profesor of Information Science and Technology at the Osaka Institute 
of Technology.  He is the founder of Mitsubishi Electric Research 
Laboratories (MERL) (<A HREF="http://www.merl.com/">www.merl.com</A>).  We licensed cube-4 to them, and they 
manifactured the VolumePro 500 board.

<P>Also visiting was Akio Doi, Ph.D., Professor of Software and Information 
Science at Iwate Prefectural University.  Professor Doi was a visitor
in residence at the Vislab six years ago.

<P><STRONG>Infrastructure Changes and Upgrades</STRONG>

<P>As discussed at the Computer Science retreat and Operations
Committee meetings the system staff has been actively testing
spam control software.

<P>Based upon points raised by the first antispam efforts the current
software will meet the following user critera:

<OL>
  <LI>zero loss of email
  <LI>Users can choose to "opt-out" of the system and deal with
      spam in their own way. Email flows uninterrupted.
  <LI>users will not be forced to change their mail reader to
      use the system
  <LI>minimal user interaction required to use the system
</OL>
<P>We have a commercial-duty spam control system called PureMessage which 
has been tested for nearly three months on the staff. PureMessage has
a very low false positive. Our configuration will assure a zero
accidental loss of email.

<P>An announcement will be made in the near future once the system is
ready for general use.

<P><STRONG>Upgrades</STRONG>

<P>During the month of September software and hardware on the department
mail server will be upgraded.  There may be some brief periods of time 
in which mail is delayed reaching you by an hour or so.  If we 
anticipate any lengthier interruption of service we will announce it
in advance.  We thank you for your patience.

<P><STRONG>PCs and Laptops</STRONG>

<P>The internet continues to be flooded by the Sobig.F computer virus,
and other viruses and worms are also still active.  Never click on
an email attachment unless you are absolutely certain you know the
content.  You should always be running up to date antivirus software
on a Windows machine.  Norton Antivirus Corporate Edition is available
for free to SB students and faculty from our downloads website at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/CSSite/AboutUs/Information/Downloads/index.html">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/CSSite/AboutUs/Information/Downloads/index.html</A> .
To access the downloads, get the login information from
/var/adm/sysinfo/info/downloads.password on any of the unix machines
in the department.

<P>Make sure that your virus definitions (for Norton Antivirus) are upto
date. You can either use LiveUpdate feature installed in the Norton
Antivirus Client or download the virus definitions manually from
<A HREF="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/defs.download.html">http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/defs.download.html</A>.

<P>If you are using Windows, make sure your computer is upto date with critical
updates / patches. Please go to<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/MiscWindowsUpdate.html">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/MiscWindowsUpdate.html</A> for instructions on how
you can do this.

<P>Ths MSDNAA program in which students and faculty can obtain free
software from Microsoft is online at <A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~msdnaa">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~msdnaa</A>.
Reminder that if you want to obtain Microsoft software through the
MSDNAA program you need to register on the website and then take the 
resulting form to the library in order to check out the CD.  You cannot 
go directly to the library without registering on the website as this 
would violate our licensing agreement with Microsoft.

<P>Email MSDNAA at cs dot sunysb dot edu if you have questions or problems.

<P>A secure backup facility for faculty PCs and laptops is under development.
An announcement will be made as soon as it is available for use.

<P><STRONG>New Facilities</STRONG>

<P>A new and experimental system was developed and put into placed which
allowed new students to check in and request a computer account on-line.  
The system allows students to request the userid of their choice, and
also makes it easier for the department to track the arrival of new
members.  This system will be refined in future semesters.

<P><STRONG>Future plans</STRONG>

<P>A department-wide mailing list service is being planned.  This will
allow users to create their own mailing lists through a simple web
interface, and also to archive up postings to the list for future
reference.  An announcement will be made once this service in in
place.

<P><STRONG><STRONG>HOW TO REPORT A PROBLEM OR MAKE A SYSTEMS REQUEST</STRONG></STRONG>
