<P><CENTER><STRONG>SYSTEMS STAFF MONTHLY UPDATE - JULY 2003</STRONG></CENTER>

<P><STRONG>Announcements</STRONG>

<P>The Graduate PC Lab (room 1239) will be closed for renovations
this Friday through Monday, August 8 - 11.

<P><STRONG>WREQ Problem Reporting Tool</STRONG><BR>
Email work requests and problem reports are now being entered into
the WREQ problem reporting tool.  You should submit all requests
directly to WREQ and not to ntadmin or individual staff members. You
can do this by posting a request through the web interface at:
<A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/%7Ewreq">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~wreq</A> or simply by sending your email request
to WREQ at cs dot sunysb dot edu.

<P>When you use WREQ for your request it goes to the entire
staff simultaneously, so that the person best able to help you
sees it immediately.  It is logged in a central location so that it
cannot accidently be overlooked in someone's mailbox.  You will
automatically receive updates by email when the problem is either
resolved or updated along the path to resolution.  Finally, you can
look it up online yourself at any point to see its status and any
notes a staff person may have made.

<P><STRONG>New or Upgraded Software for Solaris</STRONG>

<P>Some useful software for converting to html from other formats has
been installed for Solaris.

<P>The <EM>txt2html</EM> tool converts text to html.  It is available both as a
perl module and as a script.  For information see "man txt2html" or HTML::TextToHTML".

<P>The <EM>lpr2html</EM> is an lpr to html converter will translate backspace-overstrikes
and other line printer tricks generated by nroff to html. Its author
says "Simplistic, but does a suprisingly decent job of converting
manual pages and other documents."  It does not have a manual page
but "lpr2html" will show you usage options.

<P>The program <EM>man2web</EM> is for converting manual pages to HTML on the fly.
Use "man man2web" to see documentation.

<P>A reminder that the gcc compiler suite has been upgraded to version 3.2.2.
Please note that there are significant changes from the 2.x versions
and your code may require tweaking to compile under 3.2.2.  Please
visit gcc.gnu.org and look through the documentation and FAQs available
there for more information.

<P><STRONG>New or Upgraded Software on MS Windows</STRONG>

<P>Email was sent out to all faculty with a listing of software which
will be available in the Transaction Lab starting 9/3/2003.  If you
are teaching in this Lab please review the list and send mail to
NTADMIN at cs dot sunysb dot edu as soon as possible if you need software which does not
appear on this list.

<P><STRONG>VMware</STRONG>

<P>VMare accounts are available for students who would like to try out
the Linux interface and user software.  Email VMWARE at cs dot sunysb dot edu
if you would like to set up an account.

<P><STRONG>Web</STRONG>

<P>The development of the new department website is nearing completion
and we would like your input regarding the site.  The new website
can be viewed at <A HREF="http://sbtestwww.cs.sunysb.edu/">http://sbtestwww.cs.sunysb.edu/</A>.  The anticipated
launch date of the new website is the week of August 11.

<P>Please send all comments and suggestions to WEBADM at cs dot sunysb dot edu.

<P><STRONG>Infrastructure Changes and Upgrades</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Labs</STRONG>

<P>The RAID fileserver in the Visualization Lab has been upgraded to
1.8 terabytes of storage.

<P><STRONG>Upgrades</STRONG>

<P>The PCs in the Programming Techniques Teaching Lab (Roomt 2129)
have been upgraded in memory, CPU, and disk.  Six additional
machines will be added to the lab to make a total of 47 student
seats.

<P>The Multimedia Lab Imacs are being upgraded to G4s.  This upgrade
should be complete by the start of the semester.

<P>The TA Helpdesk room across from the Teaching Lab on the second
floor is being renovated, and the PCs for TA use will be upgraded
in August.

<P><STRONG>New Network Facilities</STRONG>

<P>The new Conference Room (room 2311) has become laptop-friendly
with wireless access throughout and electrical outlets at every
seat.  Please see the file /var/adm/sysinfo/info/wireless.connect
for connection information.

<P>Wireless access in the downstairs Seminar Room (room 1306) will be
available on Friday, August 15.  Please see the file
/var/adm/sysinfo/info/wireless.connect for connection information.

<P><STRONG>PCs and Laptops</STRONG>

<P>The state-wide SUNY system has a contract with Adobe that provides
SUNY with a 65% discount on Adobe's standard education prices.
The contract is handled solely through SUNY Buffalo and applies

<P><STRONG>Microsoft Critical Updates</STRONG><BR>
We have had several reports that computers on campus that have the
vulnerability outlined in Microsoft Security Bulletin 03-26
(<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/security/security_bulletins/ms03-026.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/security/security_bulletins/ms03-026.asp</A>) are
being actively attacked.  The main symptom is that a box pops up on the
screen that svchost.exe has aborted and the computer does not function
properly after that.  You should make sure you have the referenced
critical update patch installed on your Windows computer as soon as
possible.  If you need help with this please email NTADMIN at cs dot sunysb dot edu.
