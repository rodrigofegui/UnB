            <p>Best wishes to all for a Happy Holiday season and a wonderful New 
              Year! Pictures of the department holiday luncheon are on view at 
              <a href="/news/stories/Xmas2002/index.html">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/news/stories/Xmas2002/index.html</a></p>
            <p>We would like to bring your attention to WREQ, the online Systems 
              problem reporting facility. Some of you are using it already and 
              ultimately all systems related problems, questions or requests will 
              be funneled through this tool.</p>
            <p>There are significant benefits to you the user by using WREQ as 
              your problem reporting mechanism. Your request goes to the entire 
              staff simultaneously, so that the person best able to help you sees 
              it immediately. It is logged in a central location so that it cannot 
              accidently be overlooked in someone's mailbox. You will automatically 
              receive updates by email when the problem is either resolved or 
              updated along the path to resolution. Finally, you can look it up 
              online yourself at any point to see its status and any notes a staff 
              person may have made.</p>
            <p>Online, go to <a href="http://intrawww.cs.sunysb.edu/%7Ewreq/">http://intrawww.cs.sunysb.edu/~wreq/</a> 
              to post a request, view a request, or see a tutorial on its use.</p>
            <p>Via email, simply send a mail message to wreq At cs dot sunysb dot edu 
              with a brief problem description in the subject line and details 
              in the message body. Be sure as always to include all relevant facts 
              such as which machine you were on, exactly what you were doing and 
              any error messages verbatim which were returned by the system.</p>
            <p>If you experience any problems or have any questions about the 
              system send mail to root AT cs dot sunysb dot edu</p>
            <p><strong><a name="1"></a>1. New/Upgraded Software for Solaris</strong></p>
            <p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/bison.html">Bison</a>, the 
              GNU replacement for the parser generator 'yacc' has been upgraded 
              to version 1.75.</p>
            <p>The Mozilla web browser has been upgraded to version 1.3a/2002111822. 
              The Macromedia Flash Player 5 plugin has been installed.</p>
            <p> All other application helpers should work the same as they do 
              under Netscape. Please send mail to root if you have trouble getting 
              a web page or document to display properly. </p>
            <p><a href="http://www.maplesoft.com">Maple</a>, the mathematical 
              package, has been upgraded to version 8.</p>
            <p> Add /usr/local/pkg/maple8/bin to your path and then launch either 
              maple or xmaple.<br>
              Maple is a complete mathematical tool which lets you explore and 
              visualize mathematical concepts, develop technical applications, 
              and share information with the Web, MS Excel, MATLAB and your own 
              programs.</p>

            <p><strong>2. New/Upgraded Software on MS Windows</strong></p>
            <p>Quip v2.2.1.1 has been installed in the Graduate NT lab and on 
              the Grad Citrix server for CSE532.</p>
            <p>The csdlpq and csdlprm commands for printer queue management have 
              been installed in the Grad PC lab and on the Grad Citrix machine.</p>
            <p>csdlpq &lt;queue name&gt;<br>
              Queries printserv1 regarding the status of the queue name provided. 
              If the queue does not exist the error message from printserv1 is 
              reported.</p>
            <p>csdlprm &lt;queue name&gt; &lt;jobid&gt;<br>
              Requests that the specified job be removed from a print queue on 
              printserv1. No message regarding the success or failure of the request 
              is displayed, lprng does not provide any output.</p>
            <p>A job is succesfully removed if the removal request is made by 
              the user that owns the job and from the machine that the job was 
              submitted from.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Web</strong></p>
            <p><strong>FAQs and Documentation</strong></p>
            <p>SSH is now available for download from home from the <a href="/Downloads/index.html">department 
              website</a>. For instructions on how to set up an ssh tunnel so 
              that you can access other downloads including the ssh license for 
              extended use please see <a href="/FAQ/SSHTunnelingWindows.html">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/SSHTunnelingWindows.html</a> 
              (for Windows),<br>
              <a href="/FAQ/SSHTunnelingMac.html">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/SSHTunnelingMac.html</a> 
              (for Mac) or <a href="/FAQ/SSHTunnelingUnix.html">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/FAQ/SSHTunnelingUnix.html</a> 
              (for Unix).</p>
            <p>At this point the non-encrypted services ftp and telnet are no 
              longer available from outside the department. At a future date it 
              will also be necessary to use an encrypted ssh tunnel to access 
              mail via POP. See the website for free ssh client downloads and 
              FAQs on every aspect of encrypted access. If you have questions 
              about this which are not addressed in the FAQ please send mail to 
              root and we will assist you.</p>
                  <p><strong>Web Pages</strong></p>
            <p>Course Objectives survey website</p>
            <p>As part of our accreditation efforts for the Stony Brook Computer 
              Science major, we are required to assess how well each of our courses 
              are satisfying their intended objectives. A <a href="http://objsurvey.translab.cs.sunysb.edu">course 
              objectives survey website</a> was created for this purpose.</p>
            <p><strong>Upcoming</strong></p>
            <p>Servlets will soon be available on intrawww for experimental purposes. 
              Please send mail to root if you are interested in trying out this 
              feature. Note that servlets are not available for class use at this<br>
              time.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Infrastructure Changes and Upgrades</strong></p>
            <p>CDRW for Faculty/Staff in the Fax machine room.</p>
            <p>A CDRW has been installed in on the PC in the fax/printer room 
              on the first floor for faculty use.</p>
            <p>You can use your department (unix) account to login to the machine. 
              Instructions are posted above the fax machine on how to record the 
              CD. Please send email to root 
              AT cs dot sunysb dot edu if you have any questions/comments.</p>
            <p>Please note<br>
              1. Do not save any files on the desktop since they are deleted when 
              you log off from the machine.<br>
              2. Any files in c:\temp are deleted upon reboot.</p>
            <p>MSDNAA program</p>
            <p>The MSDNAA program in which students and faculty can obtain free 
              software from Microsoft will soon be in place. An announcement will 
              be made when the system is available for public use.</p>
            <p>MSDNAA program is an effort by Microsoft to distribute software 
              to students for free for non commercial use. Any student taking 
              a course in CS is eligible to get software from Microsoft. Most 
              software is included except their office products. We will be distributing 
              the software via the CS library for graduate students/faculty and 
              staff. Undergraduate students will use the program through the SINC 
              site.</p>
            <p>Students have to register at a website, select the software they 
              wish to borrow and print out a form. They need to sign and date 
              the form and give it to the library to borrow the software.</p>
            <p><strong>New labs</strong></p>
            <p>The Human-Computer Interaction Lab coordinated by Dr. Amanda Stent 
              has opened in room 2312. The lab has Pentium PC's running MS Windows 
              and will conduct research in human-computer interaction and natural<br>
              language processing.</p>
            <p><strong>Upgrades</strong></p>
            <p>WWW has been upgraded to 512 Mb. memory.<br>
              Editwww has been upgraded to an Ultra5 with 256 Mb. memory.</p>
            <p>A second VMware server has been added, This is a Dell PowerEdge 
              2000 with dual 1.8 Ghz Xeon processors and 4 GB of RAM. Please send 
              mail to root AT cs dot sunysb dot edu if you are 
              interested in experimenting with Linux on these<br>
            servers.</p>
            <p><strong>New Network Facilities</strong></p>
            <p>Our campus connection has been upgraded to 100 Mb and now seems 
              to be working well. We (and the campus) thank you for your patience 
              during the initial few days.</p>
            <p>Wireless access is now enabled throughout all the student offices 
              on the first floor. Please send mail to root if there is an office 
              from which you cannot make a wireless connection.</p>
            <p><strong>PCs and Laptops</strong></p>
            <p>In the past month we have seen both the Win32/Braid and the Yaha 
              virus on PCs or laptops. Please be sure to download and install 
              the latest virus software and definitions for your personal computer 
              or send mail to ntadmin for a department PC that needs antivirus 
              software installed or upgraded.</p>
            <p>Virus Name : W32.Yaha.F@mm<br>
              Please note that Norton Antivirus quarantines your mail folder since 
              the antivirus software is unable to repair it. Norton Antivirus 
              2003 might even delete your mail folder if it finds this virus (if 
              the options are set to automatically take care of the virus). To 
              prevent this from happening, you have to add your mail file(s) to 
              your exclusion list.<br>
              Once this is done, you can delete the infected email without losing 
              access to your mail. As always, do not run any attachments (exe's 
              or scripts), if you are unsure of the sender. If you absolutely
