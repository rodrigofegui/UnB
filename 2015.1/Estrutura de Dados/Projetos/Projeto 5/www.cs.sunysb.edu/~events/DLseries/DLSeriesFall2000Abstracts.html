              <b>Title</b>: Combinatorics of Arrangements - Recent Progress<br>
              <b>Abstract</b>: Arrangements of curves and surfaces have been a 
              major topic of study in computational and combinatorial geometry 
              for more than 15 years. The field has progressed from analysis of 
              two-dimensional arrangements in the 80's and early 90's to analysis 
              of arrangements in three and higher dimensions. The progress included 
              sharp bounds on the complexity of lower envelopes, single cells, 
              zones, vertical decompositions, as well as finding many applications 
              of these bounds to diverse areas, such as motion planning and geometric 
              optimization. </p>
            <p> In the past couple of years more progress has been made on various 
              major problems in the combinatorics of arrangements, and the purpose 
              of this talk is to survey some of this progress. The main topics 
              that I will survey are: 
            <ul>
              <li>The k-set problem: A lot of new results have been obtained, 
                starting with Dey's improved bound for k-sets in the plane, and 
                including an improved bound in 3 dimensions, an improved lower 
                bound in the plane, connection between k-sets and deep results 
                in the theory of polytopes, and improved bounds on levels in arrangements 
                of curves.</li>
              <li>Incidences between points and curves: I will survey recent progress 
                on this problem, including improved bounds for incidences between 
                points and circles and several related problems. I will also mention 
                new results concerning bounds on the number of k-simplices spanned 
                by a point set in d dimensions that are congruent to a fixed simplex.</li>
              <li>Union of geometric objects: Several new results have been obtained 
                recently, including near-quadratic bounds on the complexity of 
                the union of cylinders in 3-space, union of equal cubes in 3-space, 
                union of fat convex bodies in the plane, and more.</li>

            Fekete</b></a>, University of Sydney<br> <b>Title</b>: Making Snapshot 
            Isolation Serializable<br> <b>Abstract</b>: Snapshot Isolation (SI) 
            is a multi-version concurrency control algorithm. SI is attractive 
            because it never delays read operations, not even when concurrent 
            writes are occurring. SI has been implemented by Microsoft Exchange 
            and Oracle (with certain variations), and it provides an isolation 
            level that avoids many of the common concurrency anomalies. SI does 
            not guarantee serializability, however. Like most protocols that fail 
            to guarantee serializabiliy, SI can lead to arbitrarily serious violations 
            of integrity constraints. Fortunately there are applications where 
            the program logic guarantees that only serializable executions can 
            take place, one example being the TPC-C benchmark. 
            <p> We present a new theory with which the DBA can examine the program 
              logic of the application to achieve one of the following two goals: 
            <ol>
              <li>To verify that only serializable executions will occur when 
                running on a DBMS which has SI as its concurrency control algorithm.</li>
              <li>If 1 fails, to modify the application programs so that such 
                serializability will be guaranteed. 
            </ol>
            <p>Our goal is to bring concurrency safety to the many applications 
              running on systems with SI as the concurrency control mechanism.

            University of Toronto<br> <b>Title</b>: Artificial Animals (and Humans): 
            From Physics to Intelligence<br> <b>Abstract</b>: I will present research 
            spanning the fields of computer graphics, computer vision, and artificial 
            life, an emerging discipline that bridges computational science and 
            biological science. We have created physics-based virtual worlds inhabited 
            by realistic "artificial animals". Our synthetic fauna possess muscle-actuated 
            bodies, sensors, and brains with motor, perception, and behavior centers. 
            Artificial animals - including, of course, artificial humans - are 
            of interest in computer graphics because they are self-animating characters 
            that dramatically advance the state of the art of production animation 
            and interactive games. As biomimetic autonomous agents situated in 
            realistic virtual worlds, artificial animals also foster a deeper, 
            computationally oriented understanding of biological information processing. 
            For example, they enable a new paradigm for computer vision research 
            which exploits virtual reality. I will demonstrate virtual animals 
            and humans perceptually navigating their dynamic 3D worlds, their 
            foveated eyes controlled by active vision algorithms that analyze 
            afferent retinal image streams. Artificial animals are furthermore 
            valuable to the study of learning and cognition in living systems. 
            I will show how they can master muscle-actuated locomotion and learn 
            advanced motor skills guided by sensory perception. Finally, knowledge 
            representation and reasoning formalisms from artificial intelligence 
            support the cognitive mind of "Homo sapiens syntheticus". A multimedia 
            presentation will render this talk accessible to all. </td>

            Speaker</b>: <a href="http://www-nt.cs.berkeley.edu/home/necula/public_html/"><b>George 
            Necula</b></a>, U. C. Berkeley<br> <b>Title</b>: Oracle-Based Checking 
            of Untrusted Software<br> <b>Abstract</b>: Proof-carrying code (PCC) 
            has been proposed as a general mechanism that allows the receiver 
            of an untrusted program to check the program's compliance with certain 
            key safety policies, such as type safety or disciplined resource management. 
            To make this possible the program comes accompanied by an easy-to-check 
            proof of compliance; this leaves to the receiver the easy task of 
            proof checking. One of the major applications of PCC to date has been 
            to instrument a Java compiler to produce proofs of type safety along 
            with the optimized machine code. This enables a Java client to combine 
            the speed of compiled code with the safety checking of bytecode, all 
            in a slim package consisting mostly of a machine code parser and a 
            proof checker. 
            <p> In this talk we review the basic motivation and design of a PCC 
              infrastructure for Java and then we focus on novel aspects of the 
              design that enabled us to scale to Java programs up to 100,000 lines. 
              First, we observed that actual proofs of Java type safety can be 
              very large even though they are quite shallow in mathematical content. 
              This motivated us to develop a variant of PCC in which the proof 
              checker is replaced by a non-deterministic theorem prover, which 
              is simple yet quite powerful. The proof is then replaced by a sequence 
              of bits acting as an oracle that the prover uses to resolve its 
              non-deterministic choices. If the oracle guides the prover to success 
              then the code is accepted.</p>
            <p> There are many advantages to this oracle-based design of PCC, 
              most notable of which being that the size of oracles adapts naturally 
              to the complexity of the property being checked. In the particular 
              case of proofs of type safety for assembly language programs obtained 
              from Java source programs, the oracles are only 15% of the size 
              of machine code, which is more than an order of magnitude smaller 
              than the corresponding proofs. We will conclude the presentation 
              with a discussion of a number of other design and engineering choices 
              that were necessary to achieve scalability.</p>

            Algorithms and Data Structures<br> <b>Abstract</b>: Computer architects 
            are magicians: they make us believe the ludicrous proposition that 
            50-nanosecond RAM can keep up with 1-nanosecond processors. Most of 
            the time, we fall for their cruel hoax because of the wonder of caches: 
            small, fast memories that apparently give us huge volume at low cost 
            and fast speed. Most programmers receive the benefits of caches without 
            worrying about the mechanism. Cache-conscious software design takes 
            caching into account, and thereby speeds up some programs. This talk 
            shows how cache-conscious algorithms and data structures can achieve 
            speedups of up to an order of magnitude across a wide variety of machines.

            Speaker</b>: <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/annual_report/Schneider.htm"><b>Fred 
            B. Schneider</b></a>, Cornell University<br> <b>Title</b>: The Design 
            and Deployment of COCA<br> <b>Abstract</b>: COCA is a fault-tolerant 
            and secure on-line certification authority that has been built and 
            deployed both in a local area network and in the Internet. Replication 
            is used to achieve availability; proactive recovery with threshold 
            cryptography is used for digitally signing certificates in a way that 
            defends against mobile adversaries which attack, compromise, and control 
            one replica for a limited period of time before moving on to another. 
            Relatively weak assumptions characterize environments in which COCA's 
            protocols will execute correctly. No assumption is made about execution 
            speed and message delivery delays; channels are expected to exhibit 
            only intemittent reliability; and up to 1/3 of COCA's servers may 
            be faulty or compromised. The result is a system with inherent defenses 
            to denial of service attacks because, by their very nature, weak assumptions 
            are difficult for attackers to invalidate. Moreover, COCA also introduces 
            a novel form of caching (for results of expensive cryptographic operations) 
            that blunts replay attacks. </td>
