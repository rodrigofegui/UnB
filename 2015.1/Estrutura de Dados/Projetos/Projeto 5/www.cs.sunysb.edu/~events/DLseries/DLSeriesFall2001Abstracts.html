              Verification of Parameterized Systems <br>
              <strong>Speaker:</strong> Amir Pnueli, Weizmann Institute of Science 
              and New York University<br>
              <strong>Abstract:</strong> The task of formal verification sets 
              out to establish with mathematical certainty that a reactive (hardware 
              or software) system conforms with its specification. Two main paradigms 
              are currently applied for performing this important task: MODEL 
              CHECKING which, in a fully automatic manner, exhaustively explores 
              all the reachable states of the system but is restricted to systems 
              with a finite (and not too large) number of states, and DEDUCTIVE 
              VERIFICATION, which requires user ingenuity and guidance, but can 
              be applied to infinite-state systems. </p>
            <p>In this talk, we will survey approaches which combine ideas from 
              the two methods to achieve higher degrees of automation in the verification 
              of infinite-state systems. After exploring the various sources for 
              infinity within systems, which could be due to complex control or 
              architectural structure or due to extensive data, we will identify 
              the main techniques proposed to deal with this &quot;state explosion&quot;, 
              and can be used to reduce an infinite-state system into a finite 
              one. These include the techniques of abstraction, (de)composition, 
              reduction due to symmetry, and generic instantiation. Typical successful 
              applications of these techniques are the uniform verification of 
              parameterized systems, where we consider a family of networks whose 
              size (e.g. number of processes) is a parameter, and the method is 
              able to establish its correctness for any value of the parameter.</p></td>

              of bugs with system-specific static analysis<br>
              <strong>Speaker:</strong> Dawson Engler, Stanford University<br>
              <strong>Abstract:</strong> Systems software such as OS kernels, 
              embedded systems, and libraries must obey many rules. Common examples 
              include &quot;accesses to variable A must be guarded by lock B,&quot; 
              &quot;kernel code must check user pointers for validity before dereferencing 
              them,&quot; and &quot;message handlers should free their buffers 
              as quickly as possible to allow greater parallelism.&quot; While 
              a single rule violation can crash a system, these rules are typically 
              unchecked (or even documented). </p>
            <p>The first part of this talk shows how to automatically check such 
              rules using system-specific static analysis. In our approach, system 
              builders write simple compiler extensions that automatically check 
              their code for rule violations. The approach has found thousands 
              of errors in real systems such as Linux, OpenBSD, the Xok exokernel, 
              and the FLASH machine's embedded software. Most extensions were 
              less than a hundred lines of code and written by implementers who 
              had a limited understanding of the systems checked.</p>
            <p>The second part of the talk describes how to automatically infer 
              rules from the source code itself rather than having to know them 
              a priori. The cornerstone of our approach is inferring &quot;beliefs&quot; 
              from code that we then cross-check for contradictions. Beliefs are 
              facts implied by code: a dereference of a pointer, &quot;p&quot;, 
              implies a belief that &quot;p&quot; is non-null, a call to &quot;unlock(l)&quot; 
              implies that &quot;l&quot; was locked, etc. For beliefs we know 
              the programmer must hold, such as the pointer dereference above, 
              we immediately flag contradictions as errors. For beliefs that the 
              programmer may hold, we can assume these beliefs hold and use a 
              statistical analysis to rank the resulting errors from most to least 
              likely. For example, if a call to &quot;spin_lock&quot; is paired 
              with a call to &quot;spin_unlock&quot; 1000 times and not paired 
              1 time, this is a good indication that the code believes these calls 
              must be paired, and that the single deviation is an error. The key 
              feature of this approach is that it requires no a priori knowledge 
              of truth: if two beliefs contradict, we know that one is an error 
              without knowing what the correct belief is. Belief analysis allows 
              us to infer 10-100 times things to check than if we relied on manual 
              specification and to check properties we found impractical to manually 
              specify.</p>

              for Augmented Reality <br>
              <strong>Speaker:</strong> Steven Feiner, Columbia University <br>
              <strong>Abstract: </strong>As computers grow ever smaller and faster, 
              the option of wearing them, rather than carrying or sitting in front 
              of them, is rapidly becoming a reality. One especially promising 
              approach for wearable user interfaces is augmented reality, in which 
              the physical world is augmented with additional information. For 
              example, a see-through, head-worn display can be used to overlay 
              computer graphics on what the user normally sees. </p>
            <p>This talk provides an overview of the work being done by Columbia's 
              Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Laboratory to explore user 
              interface design for collaborative mobile augmented reality systems. 
              One issue that I will discuss is environment management, by which 
              I mean the task of managing the presentation of a large number of 
              virtual objects on many displays for many users. The use of see-through 
              displays has a profound effect on the user interface, precisely 
              because virtual objects appear in the same surrounding space as 
              other users and physical objects. Thus, as a user's head moves, 
              or anything visible through their see-through display moves, the 
              user's combined view of the virtual and physical world also changes. 
              For example, a static virtual object intended to be viewed next 
              to a physical object may suddenly obscure or be obscured by it or 
              other objects. To address these problems, we have developed a prototype 
              environment management component that interactively manages the 
              geometry of virtual objects to maintain desired viewplane relationships 
              between them and other physical and virtual objects. </p>

              Interaction <br>
              <strong>Speaker:</strong> Mark Wegman, IBM T.J. Watson Research 
              Center <br>
              <strong>Abstract:</strong> Programmers are increasingly programming 
              by component assembly. This is despite the fact that the use of 
              components tend to decrease the performance of the program. The 
              programmers who design the components do not know anything about 
              the environment the components will be used in, and can therefore 
              not tailor the components for each specific use. For modularity 
              reasons the users of components should not know what is in them. 
              The efficiency of a program suffers from the use of such generic 
              components, since it fundamentally depends on the interactions between 
              the components (including calling callee interactions). The performance 
              of a component based program is therefore often less than optimal. 
            </p>
            <p>Optimizing component interaction is a fundamental problem in constructing 
              efficient component-oriented programs. Our work lays out a foundation 
              for reformulating the implementation of the interaction between 
              components, with the goal of optimizing the assembled system. Our 
              approach amounts to automatically choosing among a number of candidate 
              implementation alternatives for each of the data structures and 
              communication mechanisms that the components use during their interactions. 
              This choice is done by an interesting combination of dynamic and 
              static analysis. The system becomes aware of alternatives one component 
              can offer to another and what kinds of uses another requires and 
              so we can get the two interacting better via the system than seems 
              permissible with good software engineering practice. </p>
            <p>Some of our initial work in this area has shown how to transform 
              one example of component interaction optimization into a graph problem, 
              and has proposed analysis of dynamics and fast graph reduction heuristics 
              as an efficient technique for solving the problem. Our hope is that 
              this work will inspire debate that ultimately will lead to a new 
              area of investigation, within the field of compiler-performed optimization, 
              with the potential to achieve orders of magnitude improvements in 
              the performance of component-oriented programs. </p>

              Hart will display and explain a range of his mathematically based 
              sculptures and the algorithms that underlie them. These include

              paper, or common household objects, plus computer-assembled sculptures 
              made by &quot;rapid prototyping&quot; techniques. Also shown will 
              be three-minute videos of the assembly of two recent large commissions: 
              a six-foot sculpture constructed from 642 CDROMs at the Computer 
              Science building at U.C. Berkeley, and a five-foot sculpture constructed 
              at a community &quot;barn raising&quot; event, at the Northport 
              Public Library. </p>

              and the Imminent Revolution in Brain Science <br>
              <strong>Speaker:</strong> Tom M. Mitchell, Fredkin Professor of 
              Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University<br>
              <strong>Abstract:</strong> The study of the human brain is undergoing 
              a major revolution due to the recent invention of new, highly precise 
              techniques for measuring human and animal brain activity. For example, 
              functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) now provides scientists 
              a safe, non-invasive means of producing a three-dimensional &quot;movie&quot; 
              of human brain activity with a spatial resolution of 3mm, and a 
              temporal resolution of 300 milliseconds (i.e., three snapshots per 
              second). As a result, scientists are able for the first time to 
              see the detailed patterns of cortical activity that constitute human 
              cognitive processes such as language processing, vision, memory 
              and problem solving. This talk will overview these new techniques 
              and recent scientific results, and will examine the significant 
              role that artificial intelligence and computer science can play 
              in the coming revolution in brain science. </p></td>
